# Marketing Leads Attribution Model

**Marketing is responsible for bringing new leads and correctly attributing and enriching them to be sent to the sales team. The data flow starts when a new contact enters Hubspot and from this point, its origin and interest must be clear for the salesperson to work with the lead.**

## **Lifecycle Stage and Sales Status**

To identify and assign workflows for sales processes, we have in CRM and Hubspot the fields for Stages and Status\*\*. \*\*

**Lifecycle Stages (Lead, MQL, SQL, Opportunity, Customer):** focused on letting us to know the maturity of the contact, his relationship with sales.\
**Sales Status (New, In Progress, Disqualified, Refer to Partner, Customer):** helps us to know about our relationship with the contact, if already in progress, etc. This is important to know for how long sales is working with the contact and help us to create strategies around it.\
\*\*Current Status (Active, Inactive): \*\*can be used in all times for contacts, meaning if there is any active sales/customer relationship or not.

Both contacts and accounts have stages and status. An Account stage and status is defined by the most advanced contact stage/status. Stage Client predominate on others.

If we get new contacts to existing accounts, they will follow a brand new process, being recognized as a MQL/PQL and human interaction to understand if a new sales opportunity will be needed.
