# Backend

## Purpose

The Backend Team is responsible for Rocket.Chat's core development, being responsible for things like the REST and real-time APIs, login integrations such as OAuth, LDAP and etc, mobile and desktop notifications and so on.

## Forum

There's an [internal category in our forums](https://forums.rocket.chat/c/internal/5). It's encouraged that everyone share ideas and problems there in form of discussion. It's the preferable way to communicate long discussions with your team. All discussions on this category are private.

## Community

Everyone on the team is responsible for taking care of the community issues and questions. Everyone has the same responsibility and we value very much being clear and responsible to them. Our community is super important to the company.

## Other Activities

* You SHOULD check Rocket.Chat for announcements or to answer any pending questions when you start working and before you finish your shift **at least**. You are, of course, encouraged to engage in any conversation on your channels whenever you like. Please note you are not expected to be _always_ active in chat. Everyone needs time to focus on the task at hand, this is just a rule of thumb so you don't miss out or leave anyone hanging/blocked.
* You SHOULD push your code to the _upstream_ before you finish your working hours. This way, if anything critical happens, someone else can take over the task you were working on if needed.
