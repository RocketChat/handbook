# QA Bug/Regression Severity

**CRITICAL** - A defect capable of triggering a complete system shutdown, making it impossible to continue using the App. E.g.: Installation failing or a user not able to sign/log in.

**MAJOR** - A defect capable of collapsing a specific business-critical software functionality, but other parts are still functional, so the App is still usable. E.g.: The creation of new Rooms does not work.

**MINOR** - This issue causes confusion and undesirable behavior, but not enough to affect user experience significantly. Many UI bugs are “minor” issues. E.g.: Avatar sizes being different throughout the app.

**TRIVIAL** - An issue that does not affect functionality or isn’t noticeable. E.g.: Grammar or spelling mistakes, alignment errors, and problems with third-party apps.
