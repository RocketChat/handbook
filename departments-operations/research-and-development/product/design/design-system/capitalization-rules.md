# Capitalization Rules

### Use verbs in titles 

An action-specific title shows that a button is interactive and says what happens when you use it.

### Use title-case for titles

Capitalize every word except articles, coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions of four or fewer letters.

### Keep titles short

Follow the principle of [Minimalism](../principles.md#minimalism). Overly long text can crowd your interface and may get truncated on smaller screens.
