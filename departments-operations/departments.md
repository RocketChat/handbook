# Departments

[Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/) was born as a distributed, remote-first company. Currently with team members in over 26 countries. To be able to view our amazing Rocketeers across the globe you can go to [TheOrg](https://theorg.com/org/rocket-chat).

You’ll be able to see the full structure of our organization, every team member and their roles, the size of each team, and even start putting names to faces already! On your first day you will also be added to it, so don’t worry about adding yourself.

Up next you’ll meet each of our teams, so keep TheOrg by your side as a little map during this process of learning more about the company structure.

Remember this introduction is for you to get to know all the different departments we have. You will learn more about your direct department and team after the onboarding as well.
