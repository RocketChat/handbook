# Vacations Policy

## For Brazilian Rocketeers

For those in Brazil your Vacations are planned according to the CLT legislation.

## For Rocketeers in other countries

Even if you're not in Brazil we encourage you to take at least 20 days off every year. You can choose your days, talk to your leader about the period you'll be away and then request it on Zoho People.

To [request it](https://people.zoho.com/rocketchat/zp#leavetracker/applyleave) the process is just like requesting PTO, but you use the "Vacation" leave type.
