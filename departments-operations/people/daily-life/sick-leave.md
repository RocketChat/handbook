# Sick Leave

If you need to take sick leave, please request a PTO in Zoho under the Sick/Doctor's Order category and attach any necessary documentation.

Rocket.Chat provides sick leave for up to 15 days.&#x20;

If you are a Contractor and take more than 15 days off, your contract will be automatically suspended until you can come back.&#x20;

If you are a CLT employee in Brazil, you will receive benefits from INSS following Brazilian laws. During your time off, all benefits except for the health care plan will be suspended.
