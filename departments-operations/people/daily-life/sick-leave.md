# Sick Leave

If you have a sick leave, you should ask for a PTO at Zoho (option: Sick / Doctorâ€™s order) and **attach the document from your doctor.**&#x20;



Rocket.Chat will pay up to 15 days of sick leave. If you are a contractor, on the 16th day your contract will be automatically suspended until you are good to come back. If you are an employee in Brazil, you will receive from INSS following all the local laws. The benefits (except health care plan) will be also suspended on the period you are off.&#x20;
