## Do You Know The Difference Between A Check-In Feedback Session And Regular Feedback?

Regular feedback is punctual and must be given to the Rocketeer as soon as possible to share a situation or behaviour you have observed. This is an opportunity you give to a Rocketeer to create awareness about areas of improvement, and it is also a way to live by our DOTS - being transparent, owning the responsibility, sharing your thoughts, and trusting your colleagues.&#x20;

Meanwhile, the Check-In feedback session happens twice a year and it is a specific moment of the performance review cycle when the managers get together with their team members to give feedback, talk about career and performance, align expectations and define the goals for the next semester.&#x20;

## What Is Daily Feedback?

Given very close to when the situation or the behaviour was observed, on the same day or the next 1:1 session.&#x20;

Be constructive if related to something the Rocketeer ought to improve or revise (in behaviour, activities, processes, or results) - or positive, if you want to highlight a behaviour or a result you would like to see more often in Rocket.Chat.&#x20;

Attention: be careful to have the right context and the right timing. You should avoid saying anything when you feel the receiver is not open to listening to it lie in a bad mood, upset, nervous, overreacting, or angry.

### How To Give Good Daily Feedback?

Make sure to prepare what you will say, have examples ready, and choose an appropriate environment. Follow the five steps below to help you:

1. **Context:** Provide context and explain how the situation took place;
2. **Facts:** Share what you observed and be specific about it, you should not be personal. Example: Your team member lost a deadline. Don’t say they’re disorganized! Instead state the fact: “We had this important project to deliver yesterday and I haven’t heard anything about it yet.” &#x20;
3. **Impact:** Describe how you feel or the consequences of the action;
4. **Discussion:** Check if the person understood you well and encourage them to share their version of the fact;
5. **Action:** Suggest specific and alternative behaviour and decide together what actions should be taken to avoid happening again.

### **Don’t Forget:**

**Be well-intended** - the motivation for giving feedback is trusting in the improvement of the receiver, believing in what you are saying and believing it will contribute to the person who is receiving it.

**Be straight to the point** - your message should be crystal clear. Being straight to the point doesn't mean being rude or aggressive, means being transparent and direct. Be careful with the tone of voice and the way you convey the message.&#x20;

**Do not be personal** - focus on behaviour, not people.&#x20;

**Choose the right timing** - it must be given in private.&#x20;

**We come from different cultures** - meaning we convey and receive feedback differently, but the effort of being mindful of how we’re communicating should be done by both the speaker and the listener! To learn more about this essential topic for global teams, check out the book “The Culture Map” by Erin Meyer.  &#x20;

If the receiver doesn’t agree with the feedback or overreacts, ask them to think about it and mature what was said. You can schedule a second meeting, after giving time for them to think, reflect and get their conclusions.&#x20;

## Check-In Feedback Session

The Check-in feedback session happens every 6 months after the review stage of the check-in process.&#x20;

If you're a manager and need help planning this session, click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nwRHAyR\_nbaMEQFocjnvBACN43E37Sr\_E-Uv2ZChpT4/edit#gid=0) for a complete guide.

If you receive the feedback you should also prepare yourself by keeping these suggestions in mind:

1. Listen carefully;
2. Wait until the other person finishes speaking before responding or asking for more details.;
3. "If you are unsure about the feedback you have received, don't hesitate to ask for specific examples to help clarify things.";
4. Sharing your career goals, expectations, and development with your manager is crucial to achieving success and alignment.;
5. If you have any feedback for your manager, now is a good opportunity to share it.
