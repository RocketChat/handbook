# Feedback

### Do you know the difference between a Check-in feedback session and a regular feedback?

Regular feedback is punctual and must be given to the Rocketeer as soon as possible to share a situation or behavior you have observed. This is an opportunity you give another Rocketeer to create awareness about a possible improvement, and it is also a way to live by our DOTS - being transparent, owning the responsibility, sharing your thoughts, and trusting your colleagues.&#x20;

Meanwhile, the Check-in feedback session happens twice a year and it is the specific moment of the performance review cycle when the managers get together with their team members to give feedback (regarding the past 6 months), talk about careers, align expectations and define the goals for the next semester.&#x20;

## What is daily feedback?

Given very close to when the situation or the behavior was observed, on the same day or on the next 1:1 session.&#x20;

Attention! Be careful to have the right context and the right timing. You should avoid saying anything when you feel the receiver is not open to listening to it (in a bad mood, upset, nervous, overreacting, or angry).

Can be corrective - related to something the Rocketeer needs to improve or change (in behavior, activities, processes, or results) - or positive, when you want to highlight a behavior or a result you would like to see more often in Rocket.Chat.&#x20;

### How to give good daily feedback?

First, prepare what you will say, have some examples, and make sure you are in an appropriate environment. The five steps below will also help you:

1. **Context:** Provide context and explain how the situation took place;
2. **Facts:** Share what you observed and be specific about it, you should not be personal. Example: Your team member lost a deadline. Don’t say they’re disorganized, instead state the fact: “We had this important project to deliver yesterday and I haven’t heard anything about it yet.” &#x20;
3. **Impact:** Describe how you feel or the consequences of the action;
4. **Discussion:** Check if the person understood you well and encourage them to share their version of the fact;
5. **Action:** Suggest specific and alternative behavior and decide together what actions should be taken to avoid happening again.

### **Don’t forget:**

**Be well-intended** - the motivation for giving feedback is trusting in the improvement of the receiver, believe in what you are saying and believe it will contribute to the person who is receiving it.

**Be straight to the point** - your message should be crystal clear. Being straight to the point doesn't mean being rude or aggressive, means being transparent and direct. Be careful with the tone of voice and the way you convey the message.&#x20;

**Do not be personal** - focus on behavior, not people.&#x20;

**Choose the right timing** - It must be given in private.&#x20;

**We come from different cultures** - Meaning we convey and receive feedback differently, but the effort of being mindful of how we’re communicating should be done by both the speaker and the listener! To learn more about this essential topic for global teams, check out the book “The Culture Map” from Erin Meyer.  &#x20;

If the receiver doesn’t agree with the feedback or overreacts, ask them to think about it and mature what was said. You can schedule a second meeting, after giving time for them to think, reflect and get their own conclusions.&#x20;

## Check-in Feedback Session

On the other hand, the Check-in Feedback Session happens every 6 months after the Review stage of the Check-in process.&#x20;

If you are a manager and want to know more about how to plan this session you can click here (link para o Feedback session guide) to access a complete guide.

If you’ll receive the feedback you should also prepare yourself by keeping these tips in mind:

1. Listen carefully&#x20;
2. Wait until the other person is finished to say something or to ask for more details
3. If the feedback is not crystal clear to you, ask for examples&#x20;
4. Discuss about your career, expectations, and development! Sharing these points with your manager is essential to create alignment and to help you get guidance to achieve your goals.&#x20;
5. If you have feedback for your manager, this is a good opportunity.&#x20;
