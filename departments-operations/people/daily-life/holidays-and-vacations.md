# Holidays, Vacations and Leaves

## Holidays

We have a set list of National Holidays on Zoho People, these holidays are used to send the Zoho app notifications on our #important channel.\
In [here](https://people.zoho.com/rocketchat/zp#leavetracker/holiday/list) you can check the full list. If you have a Regional Holiday coming up and it is **not on the list**, please follow these steps:

1. Send the People team the following information about the Holiday: **Name, Date, To which locations it applies.**
2. If you're sending the message on the date of the Holiday already: Just post a message complementing the automatic one that Zorro sends on important on the holiday, saying what is the holiday and where it applies to, but also do step 1 so the People team can create your holiday on Zoho.
3. _(Optional)_ Whenever you're "out of office" on a Holiday we advise you to activate the automatic message bot to let your coworkers know about it if they try to message you.\
   You can activate it by writing on open:\
   `/out-of-office out <Message saying what holiday it is today>`And when you come back the next day just write:\
   `/out-of-office in.`

## Vacations

We advise all Rocketeers, no matter where you live, to take at least 20 days of vacation a year (apart from PTO). This is important for you to have some cool down time and to maintain a healthy relationship with work. In the case of Brazilian Rocketeers, you respond to the CLT vacation rules and you should ask for the days off at least **30 days in advance**.&#x20;

> **CLT Vacations Rules:**
>
> * It is not possible to take leave before completing one year of employment;
> * After one year, you have the right to 30 days of vacations, which can be divided in as many parts as you want, as long as one has at least 14 days and the other at least 5;
> * It's possible to sell 10 days of vacations instead of taking them;
> * It's not possible to start vacations on Fridays or two days before Sundays and public holidays.

In none of these cases, we'll be able to "block" your calendar in advance, so we strongly advise you to block these days in your Google Calendar a while before to prevent people from scheduling any meetings on these special days!&#x20;

If you prefer, you can also check the rules for Brazilian employees' vacations by watching this short video:

## Maternity and Paternity leaves

The time frames for both maternity and paternity leaves vary according to local laws. As a standard minimum we establish from 120 days for maternity leaves and 30 days for paternity leaves. The employee can request the leave also through Zoho People and is free to ask for more days using the unlimited PTO benefit or based on the local legislation, if it establishes more than the company standard the highest number of days is applied.&#x20;
