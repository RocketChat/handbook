# Onboarding

With the Onboarding our main goal is to make you feel welcome and to help you fully understand your activities and expectations regarding your job, so it contains four big stages:

1. The **admission process** that started as soon as you accepted our offer letter
2. The **People onboarding**. During this stage the People Experience team welcomes you to Rocket.Chat and talks to you about internal processes of the company. 
3. **Meeting the areas**, stage during which you meet representatives of each area to understand how everything around here works.
4. **Entering your area**. At this point you meet your leader, understand the processes and projects of the area, meet your team and start getting into the daily routine of the area!

For every step of the onboarding youâ€™ll receive invites to the meetings through your Rocket.Chat email and the call links can be found inside the calendar events!
