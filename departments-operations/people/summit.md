# Summit

The Summit is the most anticipated moment for our team, as it's the time when we bring the entire team together in one place. Although attendance is optional, we highly recommend it because the Summit offers the opportunity to meet all team members in person.

Since we primarily work remotely, the Summit provides a unique chance to gather all Rocketeers in a single location and embody our Culture Code. This way, when we're all together, it feels as if we've never been far apart.

By taking part in the Summit, you can also:

* [ ] Develop and strengthen relationships;
* [ ] Gain a deeper understanding of our team's strengths and weaknesses;
* [ ] Align projects with the Executive Team for the short, medium, and long term;
* [ ] Engage in team-building activities and discussions about the company's strategies.
