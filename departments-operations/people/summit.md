# Summit

The Summit is the most expected moment for our team since it's when we bring the entire team together in one place. Although attendance is optional we highly recommend it because during the Summit you'll have the opportunity to meet all team members in person.&#x20;

As we work remotely, the Summit provides the opportunity to meet all Rocketeers in one place and to practice our Culture Code so that whenever weâ€™re all together it feels as if we never worked far from each other.

By participating in the Summit, you will also:

* [ ] Develop and strengthen relationships
* [ ] Get a deeper understanding of our team's strengths and weaknesses
* [ ] Align projects with the Executive Team for short, medium, and long-term&#x20;
* [ ] Participate in team-building moments and discussions about the company's strategies
