# External Recruitment

Our recruitment process has essentially the following steps:

1. **Resume Analysis:** Focusing on analysing the description of the candidate's experiences, fit with the level of experience required, and necessary skills for the job.
2. **Phone Screening:** To focus on initial details that are indispensable for the candidate to hold.
3. **People Interview:** The purpose of this stage is to explore deeper, with a set of behavioural questions, the candidate's fit with our culture, and explain other details about the organization and position.
4. **Hiring Manager Interview:** This interview is conducted by the hiring manager, who will be the candidate's leader in Rocket.Chat if hired. The goal here is to determine whether or not the candidate would be a strong addition to the organization in terms of experience and skills, and if they would have a good fit with the area's team.
5. **Executive Interview:** The final step of the process is a conversation with the executive responsible for the area, the goal here is to find out what motivates the candidate, answer any questions the candidate may have and let them know what to expect once a Rocketeer.

**Important Information**

* Positions for teams such as Engineering and Product also include a Technical Challenge after the People Interview.&#x20;
* Occasionally, the Hiring Manager and Executive interviews are done together to keep the agility of the process.

All of these steps are managed through **Greenhouse,** our ATS and where all involved interviewers, leaders and recruiters can collaborate during the selection process.
