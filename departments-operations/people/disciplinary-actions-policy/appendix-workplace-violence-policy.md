# Appendix: Workplace violence policy

This policy applies equally to all employees, contractors, public visitors, clients and anyone else whom employees come into contact with during work.

“Workplace violence” refers to physical acts of violence or threats to harm a person or property. Abusive behaviors, whether verbal, psychological or physical, are also considered violence. More specifically:

* Verbal abuse can be using unwelcome, embarrassing, offensive, threatening or degrading language.
* Psychological abuse is an act which provokes fear or diminishes a person’s dignity or self-esteem.
* Sexual abuse is any unwelcome verbal or physical assault.

We can’t always predict violent acts, but we ask managers and team members to be vigilant. Report any concerns or violent acts to HR as soon as possible. Examples of violent behavior among co workers include but are not limited to:

* Intimidating or bullying others
* Abusive language
* Physical assault
* Threatening behavior
* Concealing or using a weapon
* Sexual or racial harassment

All supervisors and managers are responsible to implement our policies and ensure that all procedures are free of discrimination.

Employees who witness or suspect violence, or are victims of violence, can report to HR through the [Hearing Channel Forms](https://forms.gle/1PVYgoR3c4BoXSMd8) or their immediate supervisor. We will investigate quickly and discreetly. We aim to protect victims from harassment and victimization.

Our company doesn’t tolerate violence. Any such behavior will trigger appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination, removal from boards or committees, as well as potential criminal charges.
