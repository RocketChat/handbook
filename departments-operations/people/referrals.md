# Rocketeer Referral

Do you know that moment when you see that open position for working in Rocket.Chat, and you remember that friend you had that fits **perfectly** with the description? _That person could be our next Rocketeer!_ And the **Referrals Program** exists so we can reward our Rocketeers who refer other amazing people to join our team!

How it's going to work:

1. All Rocketeers can submit referrals! To do that you just have to: Enter the [Google Workspace Dashboard](https://workspace.google.com/dashboard) > Click on the Greenhouse icon > Sign in with your Rocket.Chat email > On Greenhouse's header, click on![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (18) (4) (2) (1) (12).png>) and then on "Add a Referral".
2. Fill out the information about your referral and it's done!

If your referral **joins the team and stays for at least 90 days**, you'll get a reward sponsored by the **Referrals** system! **🍾**

**\***Hiring managers are not eligible for Referrals Reward if the candidate is indicated for a position reporting to itself once it's their responsibility to build and manage their team.

_**But are these rewards?**_

You'll get an **Experience Pass** ✨ It's be launched in the system to be credited to you as soon as you complete 3 months in the company, then the Finance team will add the value corresponding to one-month [remote benefit](https://handbook.rocket.chat/company/people/entering-rocket.chat/benefits/remote-benefit) (see values according to a location in the link) to your next paycheck.

You can use this credit to pay for experiences such as:

* An awesome dinner
* A class of something you like (maybe dancing? maybe some sport? maybe cooking?)
* A surprise breakfast for your loved one
* That game subscription you've always wanted
* An Airbnb Experience

Any questions you have just reach out to the People Experience team!
