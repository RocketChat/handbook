# Rocketeer Referral

Do you know that moment when you see an open position to work in Rocket.Chat, and you remember that colleague you have that fits perfectly with the description? That person could be our next Rocketeer! The referrals program exists so we can reward our Rocketeers who refer other amazing people to join our team. All Rocketeers can submit referrals!

Here's how it works:

1. You just need to access your [Okta dashboard](https://login.rocket.chat/app/UserHome?session\_hint=AUTHENTICATED) and click on the [Greenhouse icon](https://app4.greenhouse.io/referrals/new). This will take you directly to the right page for submitting your referral;
2. Fill out the information about your referral and it's done.

If your referral joins the team and stays for at least 90 days, you'll get an **Experience Pass** sponsored by the Referrals system! **üçæ**‚ú®&#x20;

The ammount corresponds to one month remote benefit. You can use this credit to pay for experiences such as:

* An awesome dinner;
* A class of something you like (maybe dancing? maybe some sport? maybe cooking?);
* A surprise breakfast for your loved one;
* That game subscription you've always wanted;
* An Airbnb Experience.

_Note_: Hiring Managers are not eligible for this program if the candidate is indicated for a position reporting to them, as it is their responsibility to build and manage their team.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the People Experience team!
