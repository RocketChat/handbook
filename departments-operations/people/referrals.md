# Rocketeer Referral

Do you know that moment when you see an open position to work in Rocket.Chat, and you remember that friend you have that fits **perfectly** with the description? _That person could be our next Rocketeer!_ The r**eferrals program** exists so we can reward our Rocketeers who refer other amazing people to join our team!

How it works:

1. All Rocketeers can submit referrals! To do that you just have to enter your [Okta dashboard](https://login.rocket.chat/app/UserHome?session\_hint=AUTHENTICATED) and click on the [Greenhouse icon](https://app4.greenhouse.io/referrals/new). You will be already on the right page to submit your referral!
2. Fill out the information about your referral and it's done!

If your referral **joins the team and stays for at least 90 days**, you'll get a reward sponsored by the **Referrals** system! **üçæ**

**\***Hiring managers are not eligible for Referrals Reward if the candidate is indicated for a position reporting to itself once it's their responsibility to build and manage their team.

_**But are these rewards?**_

You'll get an **Experience Pass** ‚ú® It's being launched in the system to be credited to you as soon as you complete 3 months in the company, then the Finance team will add the value corresponding to one-month [remote benefit](https://handbook.rocket.chat/company/people/entering-rocket.chat/benefits/remote-benefit) (see values according to a location in the link) to your next paycheck.

You can use this credit to pay for experiences such as:

* An awesome dinner
* A class of something you like (maybe dancing? maybe some sport? maybe cooking?)
* A surprise breakfast for your loved one
* That game subscription you've always wanted
* An Airbnb Experience

If any questions you have just reach out to the People Experience team!
