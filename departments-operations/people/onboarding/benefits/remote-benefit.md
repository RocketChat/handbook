# Remote Benefit

Being a remote team and an international company comes with many things that are non-traditional, things like getting people on remote all-team meetings. It also brings along several aspects that are quite unique to the business side, such as different ways of paying employees, perks, benefits and when to give people holidays.

One reason our benefits structure operates differently is because we are remote and international, however, another reason is that we want our benefits to reflect our values and our desire to create a workplace of the future. So here we present a proposal of benefits to be offered to our team hoping to achieve this goal.

### The Amounts

We’ve budgeted an amount to reimburse teammates for special costs. Market rates may vary as we have people based in different countries. We also have a great challenge to equalize the remote benefit, so keep in mind it will vary per region. For people relocating or moving to other countries, the Remote Benefit amount will be updated only after the updated of the new address respectively in Deel and Zoho People.

|                Region                | Monthly Amount |
| :----------------------------------: | :------------: |
| Brazil (including office boundaries) |     BRL 200    |
|            USA and Canada            |     USD 150    |
|            European Union            |     EUR 150    |
|            Other countries           |     USD 100    |

### Expensing

This policy is effective **October 1st, 2022**. The remote benefit **will be paid monthly**, and teammates can spend it as they see fit, without the need to present receipts. Below you can see how the remote benefit will be paid for each type of employee.

* **Employees and interns** based in **Brazil**
  * The amount for the Remote Benefit will be paid **monthly** in your **Caju card**. This amount will be allocated in the "Home Office" category, and can only be used in places that are included in this type of classification (for on prem or online purchases).
  * The amount accumulated **will not expire**.
* **Employees** based in the **US** and **Contractors** in **other Countries**
  * The amount for the Remote Benefit will be paid **monthly** along with your **salary**, **categorized as a Remote Benefit Reimbursement**.

### Transition Period

For those who still have some **Remote Benefit balance remaining in Zoho**, the balance will be **available for use until December 31st, 2022** (under the _previous policy for reimbursement_).

During this transition period, we wil allow for employees to request reimbursements for bills and purchases (such as energy and internet bills) made **up to six months before the request**.
