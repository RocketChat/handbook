# Remote Benefit

Being a remote team and an international company comes with many non-traditional things, things as getting people on remote all-team meetings. It also brings along several aspects that are unique to the business side, such as different ways of paying employees, perks, benefits, and when to give people holidays.

One reason our benefits structure operates differently is because we are remote and international, however, another reason is that we want our benefits to reflect our values and our desire to create a workplace of the future. So here we present a proposal of benefits to be offered to our team hoping to achieve this goal.

### The Amounts

Weâ€™ve budgeted an amount to reimburse teammates for special costs. Market rates may vary as we have people based in different countries. We also have a great challenge to equalize the remote benefit, so keep in mind it will vary per region. For people relocating or moving to other countries, the Remote Benefit amount will be updated only after the update of the new address respectively in Deel and Zoho People.
