# Company Onboarding

The onboarding starts as soon as you accept our offer letter. Recurrently, from the day you sign the offer up to your first day as a Rocketeer, you'll receive pre-boarding emails containing instructions, documents, and additional information you need for joining Rocket.Chat. A few days before your start date, you'll also receive guidance for setting up your Rocket.Chat accounts.

### The Onboarding Certification

The certification will give you a good foundation of knowledge about the company, our departments, the platforms we use, and more! So you must dedicate your first two days to completing the certification.

After completing the Certification, you will be able to:

1. Understand Rocket.Chat, from both the product and business points of view;
2. Get resources to identify teams and departmental representatives that are there to help you;
3. Find out more about the aspects of your daily life as a Rocketeer;
4. Review the tools and systems you will use daily.
