# Book Club

Running a book club is a great way for people to get together and share a common interest, and when you apply the concept to a company it not only allows you to learn something new from the book itself, but you also learn about the people within your organization.

Reading is an important tool to improve who we are, what we do, and the value we deliver in our jobs, and this is how the idea for a Rocket.Chat Book Club was born. Besides, having Share as one of our DOTS, it makes more than sense to also share some learnings, insights and well... some books!

Here's how it's going to work:

1. Each area will create a Reading Challenge with a list of books to read throughout 2021.
2. Through the year the team will mark the books in progress and completed and they can exchange ideas about it.
3. At the end of the year, everyone who scores at least 10 point in the scoreboard will receive an Amazon voucher as a prize depending on how many point you scored in total!
4. Added to this, Gabriel will periodically have a CEO Pick of book, which can be added to the areas' Reading Challenges. There will be a round table with a set date conducted by him with all who read it!

Now let's talk points and rules!

* CEO Pick - 3 points
* Books related to the area's activities, business & non-fiction - 2 points
* Other books like fiction and fantasy - 1 point

And as explained before the prizes will be distributed according to how many points you score in the following way:

* 10 points - 100 stars in the [AllStars program](https://handbook.rocket.chat/company/our-culture/rocket.chat-allstars)
* 11 to 30 points - 150 stars in the [AllStars program](https://handbook.rocket.chat/company/our-culture/rocket.chat-allstars)
* 30 points or more - 200 stars in the [AllStars program](https://handbook.rocket.chat/company/our-culture/rocket.chat-allstars)

**Suggestions to have an awesome book club routine in your team:**

* Set due dates for everyone to read the same book and have a discussion about it
* Create a channel on open to share with your team what you have been reading, recommendations and evaluations of the books you read
* Create a weekly challenge in the team of number of read pages
