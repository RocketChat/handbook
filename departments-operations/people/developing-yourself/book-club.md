# Book Club

Running a book club is a great way for people to get together and share a common interest, and when you apply the concept to a company it not only allows you to learn something new from the book itself, but you also learn about the people within your organization.

Reading is an important means to improve who we are, what we do, and the value we deliver in our careers, and this is the idea behind Rocket.Chat's Book Club. Besides, _sharing_ is one of our DOTS, it makes more than sense to also transmit some learnings, insights and well... some books!

**Here's How It Works:**

1. Throughout the year, the team will track the books in progress and completed, exchanging ideas about them.
2. At the end of the year, we will count points on each one's scoreboard!&#x20;

**Let's Talk Points and Rules!**

* CEO Pick: 3 points
* Books related to the area's activities, business, and non-fiction: 2 points
* Other books (like fiction and fantasy): 1 point

Prizes will be distributed according to how many points you score. Participants who accumulate higher points will be eligible for larger or more valuable prizes.

* 10 points - 100 stars
* 11 to 30 points - 150 stars&#x20;
* 30 points or more - 200 stars

**How To Establish A Reading Routine:**

* Set due dates by the end of each month for everyone to read the same book and schedule a discussion about it in the following week.
* Create a channel on Rocket.Chat to share with your team what you have been reading, along with recommendations and evaluations of the books you've read.
