# Performance and Career Check-In

The Check-in is the most important tool and milestone for the development of our Rocketeers. It goes beyond an evaluation of performance since it was designed to attend to three main goals:

* Evaluating performance;
* Aligning expectations about career growth;
* Developing the career path of our Rocketeers.

Our Check-in cycle is hosted at[ Qulture.Rocks](https://app.qulture.rocks/) and our rocketeers can log in through their Okta dashboard (SSO).

## The Process

The Check-in is composed of 5 steps:

1. Indications Stage;
2. Validation Stage;
3. Answer Period;
4. Reports;
5. Feedback Session / Development Plan.

To walk you through each of them, here is the[ recorded training](https://www.loom.com/share/de3ee1c4115c4018bfb86e9bf64a6dec?sid=70f14e30-d44e-4b99-92ef-37d9d9bbc595) and the[ introduction material](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15hF\_l9iLbA4j2pUyPV0Q63X02us5Slk2qgPvwRWGNzE/edit#slide=id.g28814b1ba89\_0\_489). At Qulture.Rocks' knowledge base you'll also find a collection of[ tutorials](https://help.qulture.rocks/en/collections/2438024-performance-evaluation#tutorial-for-employees) to help you during the process.

### Indications Stage

The default evaluations everyone will fill out are a self-review, a review of the manager and any direct reports you have, but you also have the option to indicate peers to evaluate you. Leaders can also indicate if they want someone to evaluate one of their team members.

If you want to participate in a peer's evaluation and give them a review just talk to them and ask them to indicate you or ask your leader to indicate you to evaluate them. Here are the three basic rules you need to follow regarding indications:

1. The system will limit the number of peer indications to 4, for everyone;
2. If you received more than 4 indications, during the indications or validation stages feel free to refuse indications from the Rocketeers you have less contact with and, therefore, less to contribute with. We indicate reviewing up to 4 peers to do a deep and healthy review;
3. Indications will not be created by system admins after the indicated period to maintain the freedom of evaluators to choose who to evaluate.

### Validation Stage

At this stage leaders will validate their teams' indications, they may remove or add people if they believe someone's input could be more valuable to your development based on their understanding of your work routine.

As previously mentioned, you can and should review all indications you received during this stage, selecting 4 from the people you have the most contact with and can contribute the most to.

At the end of the validation stage, all indications left will be automatically validated by the system.

### Answer Period

In this stage, you'll answer your self-evaluation, review your manager, any direct reports you have, and any indications you received. You’ll answer:

* Your profile: In this one, we want to look into your interests and aspirations. Do you know that dream of yours? What random skill do you have? What position do you aspire to? This is the place to talk about it. To find it, just click on "Open profile" below your name on the home page of Qulture.Rocks.
* Check-in Survey: This is the survey you'll answer inside the Review module.

### Reports

After the reviews are submitted, a report containing the results of the review will be generated and released by the leaders. This will be an important output that you'll use, together with your profile as input for your feedback session with your leader and the creation of your Development Plan. We indicate the release of the reports to be done close to the feedback session to avoid misunderstandings.

### Development Plan

After the answer period, comes the time for you and your leader to get together for the feedback session. You'll go over the report, understand the difference in perspective of the responses you received and the possible reason for that, read your profile and talk about your aspirations, and all that will point to the development areas and agreements you should focus on for the next semester.

## Engineering Performance and Career Check-In

For the Engineering Team, we are launching a more specific and structured evaluation process. For the first time, we'll be incorporating a technical skill evaluation in addition to the existing criteria, which includes alignment with our DOTS, overall performance, and contributions to our results. The primary objective behind this change is to ensure that our evaluation process remains relevant and effective, supporting your career aspirations while aligning with the company's milestones.
