# Support Ticket Life Cycle

Once you create a support case, it will be automatically directed to an available Support Analyst who can handle your issue, based on the summary and description you provided. The assigned Analyst - Level 1 will get in touch with you to comprehend the impact the problem is having on your business and gather any necessary details to effectively troubleshoot the issue.

The Support Analyst - Level 1 will follow up with you in different ways based on the [severity](https://docs.rocket.chat/resources/get-support/enterprise-support/enterprise-support-plans#ticket-severity) of the problem you're facing:

* If the issue/question can be resolved/answered quickly, the Analyst will update the case and guide you through the explanation or steps to implement the solution.
* If the issue cannot be resolved swiftly or reproduced for further troubleshooting, the Analyst may request your cooperation to gather additional information until they can replicate or resolve the issue.
* In case the Analyst cannot reproduce the issue or identify it as a product defect, the Analyst will escalate it to the Level 2 team for a thorough analysis. The Level 2 team will then take charge of addressing your case to our R\&D team for resolution. The items that have a significant impact on the customer base are given top priority.\
