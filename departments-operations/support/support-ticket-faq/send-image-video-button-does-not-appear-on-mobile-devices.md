# Send Image / Video button does not appear on mobile devices

### **Issue Description**

The customer reports that for his workspace the users cannot see the buttons for uploading media (images/videos) in chats when using mobile devices. That affects both Android and iOS.  When users press the "+" button the only thing that shows up is a 'create discussion' option. \


### **Solution**

There is a specific permission that can prevent users from being able to upload files from mobile devices. Ask the customer to navigate to Administration > Permissions and check if their users have the role **Allow file upload on mobile devices** enabled.
