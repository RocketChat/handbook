### How we work

The Data & Analytics team is one of the main Cross-Functional Teams at Rocket.Chat, working closely together with several other teams and departments. Due to this characteristic, we receive a lot of new data product requests. To better triage these requests and properly assign capacity to them, we developed a form called "[Data Request Form](https://forms.clickup.com/f/40cp1-32341/3OCIVR2FL8C9D7JHD5)", where the requestee must provide extensive details about which kind of data they need, how are they going to use it, main stakeholders, etc.

### Tutorials

We have tutorials for the following topics:

* Consolidation 2 Guide
* Monthly Company Update Tutorial
