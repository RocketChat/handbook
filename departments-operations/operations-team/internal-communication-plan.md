# Internal Communication Plan

To increase synergy and organization in the intersection between the **Sales** and the **Engineering** teams, we have created a MVP of internal communication plan which was divided into: **cross-channels organization**, **organization of channels by department**, and a **comittees structure**.

## **‌Cross-channels organization**

‌To be effective in defining the organization across channels, it is important to interview the stakeholders who are involved in the process. Understand your perspectives, needs, gaps and map them out. The second step is to define the channel objective, type of questions, stakeholders, the channel leader (a person or area) and SLA (if necessary)‌

### **Questions category**

#### ROADMAP QUESTIONS

**Type of questions:** Roadmap, suggestions of new features, new features delivery forecast\
**Resposible - receive:** Omnichannel - Renato Becker, Team Collaboration - Milton Rucks, Saas - Ricardo\
**Who can ask questions?:** Every RC employee\
**Way to notify/ask - System:** Product Suggestions - Zoho\
**Tracking:** Quarterly Committees to share the product roadmap

#### VERY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

**Type of questions:** Very technical questions about the product, implementation, code errors, etc\
**Resposible - receive:** PMs need to coordinate and direct the question to the technical responsible\
**Who can ask questions?:** Pre-sales team & CS\
**Way to notify/ask - System:** Channel exclusive (PMs + Pre-Sales + Support leaders + Tech Leads)\
**Tracking:** Extreme Technical Questions most of time don’t have a SLA. How to track the process?

#### PRODUCT BAD BEHAVIOR - CRITICAL SITUATIONS

**Type of questions:** Technical questions about RC bad behavior during customer calls, livechat, product demonstrations, etc\
**Resposible - receive:** Technical Leads team\
**Who can ask questions?:** Pre Sales team & CS\
**Way to notify/ask - System:** Channel exclusive (Tech Leads + PM & CS)\
**Tracking:** SLA support team - FCR (first contact resolution) - During Working hour (Product team)

#### PRODUCT BAD BEHAVIOR - NON-CRITICAL SITUATIONS

**Type of questions:** Technical questions about RC bad behavior during self navigation or non-critical situations\
**Resposible - receive:** PMs\
**Who can ask questions?:** Every RC employee\
**Way to notify/ask - System:** Report Bugs - Forms\
**Tracking:** How to track?

## **Organization of channels by department**

**‌**From time to time, the structure of teams within Rocket.Chat needs to be revised. It is important to review the entire structure, understand the teams' needs and address them in the right channel.

‌We developed a channel structure for the sales team, based on the fact that the team is growing rapidly and some parts of the processes needed to be more visible to the team.

‌Creating channels with automated CRM messages can be a smart and quick way to bring more transparency to your sales force

## **Committees structure**

Understanding the types of communication is a good starting point for defining your organisation/department's committee structure. What kind of news / announcements can be part of a channel? What kind of information is better to be in a meeting than in a channel?

Channels are not the right place to share strategic announcements, they are the right place to support a strategic announcement made by the CEO in a company-wide meeting, for example.
