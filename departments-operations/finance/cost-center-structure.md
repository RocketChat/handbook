# Cost Center Structure

## What is a Cost Center?

A cost center is a structure that represents a department in a company to which costs can be allocated.

The cost center's main function is to track all expenses linked to a particular function or department, which supports our Profit & Loss/ Financial Results structure, as well as budget department owners controls.

## Cost Center Structure

Whenever your team uses part of their budget to \*\*purchase \*\*something, the expenses **will be allocated to your specific department's cost center**, as well as salaries and contractors costs.

Below, is our Cost Center structure.
