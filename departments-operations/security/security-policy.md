# Security Policy

Page 1We have created a general information security policy and specific policies for related topics and are working to put them in place. These policies are necessary to set up secure processes and demonstrate our compliance with industry standards towards our customers. You can also find the annual acknowledgment forms here.

In case of any questions, contact the security team. More information on [this page](https://rocket.chat/handbook/departments/security/)

## Mandatory Acknowledgment & Secure Configuration

Because we all must follow our security policies, we have set up GoogleForms that you can fill out and submit. Use the following 3 checklists to set yourself up securely:

* [Policy Acknowledgment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5NwjKNXQl9gQPhgF93iB2clFPY2tiYVIE3PKEL\_ZaswTkkw/viewform?usp=sf\_link), an acknowledgment for our current policies. Mandatory to complete annually by all employees
* [Security configuration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffmdQUSHaE2WWX6UHo8BAqT6VM0ijBPxyWwJCkmgeRvSpvkA/viewform?usp=sf\_link), a checklist to set up a basic secure configuration of your tools. Mandatory to complete annually by all employees.

## Overall Security Policy

Overall Management intention on security and baseline for our security management system.

### Purpose

Rocket.Chat places a great emphasis on protecting its information. Such information includes e.g. information we manage on behalf of our customers, personnel files, our intellectual property.

At Rocket.Chat, we aim to ensure at all times that information we manage is appropriately secured to protect against the consequences of breaches of confidentiality, failures of integrity or interruptions to the availability of that information.

Our objectives are:

* We will meet all applicable requirements in properly protecting our information, including: laws, regulations, industry standards and contractual commitments
* The protections we apply to information assets will be in proportion to the value and sensitivity of the information, and will balance the sensitivity of the information against the cost of controls, the impact of the controls on the effectiveness of business operations and the risks against confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information
* We will ensure that these controls are accepted by all employees, vendors, service providers, representatives and associates of our company who may have access to our information. This includes ensuring that all personnel at all levels are aware of, and are held accountable for safeguarding information assets
* We will identify and mitigate any breaches to this policy.
* We aim to continually improve our security practices over time.

### Applicability and Ratification

This information security policy provides management direction and support for information security across the organisation. Specific, subsidiary information security policies, procedures and guidelines are considered an integral part of this information security policy, because only when followed in its entirety, we can ensure the objectives of this policy are met. This policy has been ratified by Rocket.Chat´s management team and forms part of its policies and procedures. It is applicable to and will be communicated to our staff, contractors, students and other relevant parties.

### Responsibilities

Everyone handling Rocket.Chat information has the responsibility to keep the information safe, no matter where the information is located. This includes our staff members, contractors, students, etc., but also our suppliers (e.g. those that provide us with our tools to work) and other recipients of that information.

To determine the appropriate levels of security measures applied to information systems, a process of risk assessment is carried out to identify the probability and impact of security failures.

To manage information security within the organisation an information security oversight committee is established, chaired by Rocket.Chat´s Security Lead and consisting of senior members of our relevant teams. The objective of this committee is to ensure that there is clear direction and visible management support for security initiatives. This oversight group shall promote security through appropriate commitment and adequate resourcing.

An information security working party, comprising management representatives from all relevant parts of the organisation, shall devise and coordinate the implementation of information security controls. The responsibility for ensuring the protection of information systems and ensuring that specific security processes are carried out shall lie with the head of the department managing that information system.

Specialist advice on information security is available throughout the organisation. Any member of the organization can contact his manager or directly Rocket.Chat´s Security Lead.

Rocket.Chat will establish and maintain appropriate contacts with other organisations, law enforcement authorities, regulatory bodies, and network and telecommunications operators.

Violations of our policies will be handled in accordance with the severity of the violation and applicable rules and regulations, including up to termination of contract for severe violations.

### Review

This policy is reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that it remains appropriate in the light of any relevant changes to the law, our other policies or contractual obligations. We will inform relevant parties about the updates.

The implementation of the information security policy shall be reviewed independently of those charged with its implementation.

## Security Special Policies

The following are subpolicies related to specific areas and supplement the general policy.

## Organization

We maintain a [RASCI-chart](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10oSnNvSqx5OObvXyIjrAkOZLNFEc6n6d/view?usp=sharing) that contains the responsibilities around information security. Conflicts of interest in these responsibilities must be avoided and tasks that create these conflicts be assigned to different persons. Where this is not possible, compensating controls (e.g. four-eyes principle) should be considered.

Current conflicting roles identified:

* The roles of data protection officer and security lead are currently taken by one person and cases of conflict of interest will be raised to the management team to resolve.

The company maintains relevant contacts with authorities and agencies, those relevant for Rocket.Chat being mostly:

* Data protection agencies
* NIST
* ISO
* Open Source Community

In project management, the project leads are responsible to ensure security is properly addressed in a project.

## Personnel Security

All personnel is screened before entering a position and subject to a Terms of employment, including a duty of confidentiality. The screening process is in relation to the applicable laws and regulations as well as the requirements of the position. All personnel is subject to contractual terms that describe their duties. The Information Security Team ensures that all personnel is aware of Rocket.Chat´s Security policies. Personnel that is leaving Rocket.Chat must certify that all assets have been returned to the company and then will be de-registered from the user directories.

The details of these processes are implemented and the records kept by the Human Resources Team.

## Asset Management

An asset is something of value for Rocket.Chat such as, but not limited to, information itself, a device, intellectual property.

[This policy](security-policy/assets-management.md) cover important security aspects and guidelines that help rocketeers to protect and avoid any misuse of company owned assets.

The lists of assets can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nh8T3FP7QGR35jAdbd9j6HQnnirQDNcnC7X9Dg-Kdvo/edit?usp=sharing)

### Homeoffice / Remote Work

Refer to [Remote work policy](security-policy/remote-work.md)

## Cryptography and Key management

Cryptography is the practice of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format, which can only be understood by those who have the key to unlock it. Cryptography is used in various applications, such as secure communication, digital signatures, and data protection.

Key management is the practice of protecting and managing the cryptographic keys used in encryption and decryption. It involves generating, storing, exchanging, and revoking keys to ensure that the encryption and decryption process remains secure. Proper key management is essential for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information that is encrypted using cryptographic algorithms. Key management also includes ensuring the authenticity of the keys, so that the right person or entity can access the encrypted information.

For detailed information and guidelines refer to [Cryptography and Key management](security-policy/cryptography-and-key-management.md) session

## Authentication and Password Policy

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system entity. It is a security mechanism that helps to ensure that only authorized individuals or systems are granted access to a particular resource, such as a system, network, or application.

Here you can find our detailed [Authentication](security-policy/authentication-and-password-policies.md#authentication) and [Password policy](security-policy/authentication-and-password-policies.md#password-policy)

## Secure Development & Change Management

Secure engineering basic principles:

Features or changes involving components that could affect overall system security (e.g. authentication, encryption, access control) should consider the following steps:

* have a thoroughly documented PR explaining the change
* the PR must pass all checks, alerts must be remediated before merging
* be subject to the regular tests (including security tests) before a release and not be introduced after these tests
* should check if documentation needs to be updated and if so, update it

Changes to assets should only occur when a change is necessary. All changes must be controlled. All changes related to source code must occur through the authorized version control system (e.g. GitHub). In case a change is urgent, the change control process may be shortened by decision of management, in order to mitigate potential damages to the organization.

## Accessing Customer Data

For access to customer data, you must adhere to the following:

You may only access customer data if

* The customer specifically requests it (e.g. support request) _or_
* When it is necessary for us to fulfill our contractual obligations (e.g. to act proactively to prevent an instance from failing)

Access is strictly limited to the data needed to fulfill the request. You may not access data of other customers. No customer data may be extracted unless this is strictly requested by the customer. All data extracted must be stored safely and deleted when it is no longer necessary.

You must terminate the session immediately after the reason for your access has been resolved. You must as soon as possible inform the customer of the outcome of your access.

## Incident Management

An incident is any event that has the potential to affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of Rocket.Chat information, in any format, or IT systems in which this information is held. Violations of laws, policies, contractual obligations or also external requests should also be considered as incidents in this sense.

Examples of incidents include:

* Lost devices
* A suspicious and successful log in
* Malware incident
* Ransomware attack
* Email with confidential data sent to wrong recipient
* Law enforcement requests to disclose data of customers

General Incident Process:

1. Logging the incident
2. Assigning it to the proper team to investigate
3. Triage
4. Escalation (if needed)
5. Resolution, including implementation, testing, as well as reaching out to other parties necessary. Before advancing, the affected user or customer must also be in agreement that the incident has been resolved.
6. Closing

The Security Team will produce metrics on the incidents occurring in order to reduce their occurrence and improve our process. The detailed process is in the playbooks section of the security team.

Incidents happen and it is important for Rocket.Chat to be aware of them and taking proper action. In case you feel you are in a conflict of interest or in fear of potential repercussions of reporting an incident, you can confidentially contact the HR team or the Security team and your incident report will be submitted anonymously.

## Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

Business Continuity ensures that regular business will continue even during a disaster.

Disaster recovery means restoring vital support systems and is a subset of business continuity.

### Disaster prevention:

Disaster prevention is everyone´s responsibility. This means that every employee must actively prevent disasters from occurring and report potential risks of a disaster to management. Most controls to prevent disasters are taken on a system level by the respective system administrator and will be performed against a system specific control catalog (e.g. backup configuration). Since many of our systems rely on third party providers, following our policies for third parties is critical. Disaster Prevention controls include:

* Redundancy of the network in the office
* Preventing vendor lock-ins
* Chosing of trusted partners that provide an adequate level of security (e.g. SaaS providers)
* Storing data offsite and off-client

### Criticality ratings:

Rocket.Chat maintains a list of all systems, including a rating of their criticality on our business processes. This criticality is mostly based on tolerable downtime. The criticality ratings are defined in specific DR documents. Criticality ratings to a system may be adjusted on a case-by-case basis where the circumstances justify the adjustment. Rocket.Chat also runs a risk management program to identify and manage risks, including risks of a disaster occuring.

### Disaster Recovery:

In case of a disaster, we will form an incident response team consisting of the respective members of our management team, security and other individuals, depending on the type of disaster. The members of the team will communicate using Rocket.Chat - or where this is not possible - email or phone. We will inform all affected employees via the Rocket.Chat channel "important" or others where relevant. In case the disaster has taken down the rocket.chat servers, we will notify via email or - where warranted - contact you via the phone numbers you have given us during onboarding. The incident response team will also ensure that affected customers are informed via the proper methods.

### Testing:

Annually, we test our business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities. The scope and method of testing are related to our risk management process and decided by management. The results of these tests are shared in the company and may lead to updates to this policy.

## Procurement

All Systems procured must comply with defined information security requirements. Those requirements are defined before a procurement decision is made.

## Supplier Relationship

A supplier relationship refers to the interaction and collaboration between a company or organization and Rocket.Chat. It encompasses the various ways in which our company manages and interacts with suppliers, such as procurement processes, contract negotiation, quality management, communication, and collaboration on innovation and product development. The goal of building a strong supplier relationship is to create a mutually beneficial partnership that promotes long-term sustainability, reliability, and value for both Rocket.Chat and its suppliers.&#x20;

This policy applies to the security and compliance of supplier relationships. Maintaining a secure supply chain is important because often vulnerabilities and risks are introduced through supplier relationships.&#x20;

Suppliers can be SaaS providers, hardware suppliers and similar.

### Contracts & Service levels:

Relationships with suppliers must be based on written agreements/contracts. Such contracts must include provisions on information security when necessary. Service levels of suppliers must be agreed upon and monitored, e.g. by monitoring uptime reports, quality of service, and in case the service does not meet the expected level, the supplier be notified to remediate the issues. Changes to the provision of services by vendors, including changes to agreements, must be recorded (e.g. a contract amendment).

### Supplier access & privacy:

Suppliers accessing or processing Rocket.Chat data must be subject to an NDA or other confidentiality clauses. They must follow either our privacy policy or have their own, legally compliant privacy policy.

For cases when supplier needs to access Rocket.Chat information, then the Vendor Risk Assessment Questionnaire must be sent to the supplier or vendor.

A security questionnaire is a set of questions that is used by a Rocket.Chat to evaluate the security posture of suppliers. The purpose of the security questionnaire is to assess the level of risk associated with working with a particular supplier and to identify any potential security vulnerabilities that may exist in their systems, ecosystems or processes.

Our security questionnaire has questions covering topics such as Access Controls, Compliance, Incident Management, Risk Management, Vulnerability Management among others.

The questionnaire template can be found \<HERE>&#x20;

Once responded, the questionnaire must be made available to the security and compliance teams for risk assessment.

### Supplier compliance:

Supplier compliance is assessed on a risk-based approach and against the requirements of our security policies. Suppliers must demonstrate the same level of compliance for their supply chain.

### Supplier Monitoring:



&#x20;Quando iniciar contato com algum fornecedor que precise de alguma forma acesso a informaçoes da RC, enviar o questionário.

Pedir 2 semanas para a resposta

Depois enviar a resposta do possível vendor para \<emails>

Se o time encontrar alguma red flag, contato com o fornecedor deve ser feito.

## Auditing

The Information Security Team will audit the design and implementation of these policies on a regular basis, with a focus on risks identified in the risk management process. Where a potential conflict of interest takes place, the audit will be delegated to another individual with such conflict or other compensating controls be taken.
