# Awareness and Training

Awareness means putting someoneÂ´s attention on security challenges. Training means giving people the right level of security skills for their job.

## Awareness

At Rocket.Chat, we can build on a tech-savvy team that has a broad knowledge of security topics and specializations. Therefore we focus on raising an awareness on new things that happen. Goal: Keep all members of Rocket.Chat appraised of new and current developments in the security landscape

The program is focused on 2 main steps: training and security tests

The tests may take the shape of a simulated phishing email, simulated SMS phishing or phone call.

### How to report a phishing email

In rocket.chat we use a phishing report integration from KnowBe4, called [Phish Alert Button](https://www.knowbe4.com/phish-alert). It is a orange hook add-on integrate with your corporate Gmail that is already pre-installed in every platform that you access your rocket.chat email.

Always use the integration to report suspected phishing email. If it a simulated email you will view a message congratulating your for finding out the simulated campaing. If it a potential real phishing email the email will be send to the security team for further analysis.
