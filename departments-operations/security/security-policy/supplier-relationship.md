# Supplier Relationship

This policy applies to the security and compliance of supplier relationships. A supplier relationship refers to the interaction and collaboration between a company or organization and Rocket.Chat. It encompasses the various ways in which our company manages and interacts with suppliers, such as procurement processes, contract negotiation, quality management, communication, and collaboration on innovation and product development. Maintaining a secure supply chain is important because often vulnerabilities and risks are introduced through supplier relationships.

Suppliers can be SaaS providers, hardware suppliers and similar.

#### Contracts & Service levels:

Relationships with suppliers must be based on written agreements/contracts. Such contracts must include provisions on information security when necessary. Service levels of suppliers must be agreed upon and monitored, e.g. by monitoring uptime reports, quality of service, and in case the service does not meet the expected level, the supplier must be notified to remediate the issues. Changes to the provision of services by vendors, including changes to agreements, must be recorded (e.g. a contract amendment).

#### Supplier access & privacy:

Suppliers accessing or processing Rocket.Chat data must be subject to an NDA or other confidentiality clauses. They must follow either our privacy policy or have their own, legally compliant privacy policy.

For cases when supplier needs to access Rocket.Chat information (e.g a vendor that needs to process data from some internal system), then the **Vendor Risk Assessment Questionnaire** must be sent to the supplier or vendor.

The Vendor Risk Assessment Questionnaire is a set of questions that is used by a Rocket.Chat to evaluate the security posture of suppliers. The purpose of the questionnaire is to assess the level of risk associated with working with a particular supplier and to identify any potential security vulnerabilities that may exist in their systems, ecosystems or processes.

Our questionnaire contains questions covering topics such as Access Controls, Compliance, Incident Management, Risk Management, Vulnerability Management among others.

The questionnaire template can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15fW9glMGYLwsrx\_RgLHaE1xJkimWc4hV).

* Make a local copy of the questionnaire.
* Send to the supplier as attachment.
* Once responded by the supplier and sent back, the questionnaire must be made available to the [security](mailto:security@rocket.chat) and [compliance](mailto:mayara.santos@rocket.chat) teams for risk assessment. Please mention the purpose of the relationship with the supplier.
* The Security and Compliance teams will raise flags if necessary and a proper contact with the supplier must be made to notify about Rocket.Chat's concerns.

Note: If you have questions whether the questionnaire should be sent to a vendor or not, please contact Compliance or Security teams.

#### Supplier compliance:

Supplier compliance is assessed on a risk-based approach and against the requirements of our security policies. Suppliers must demonstrate the same level of compliance for their supply chain.

#### Supplier Monitoring:

For suppliers with certifications we will evaluate on a yearly basis if those certifications remain valid (e.g ISO or SOC2) as well as their privacy policies.
