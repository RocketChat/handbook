# Pentest

## Internal pentest

Currently we are not performing complete internal pentest on a regular basis.

Pentests are performed when the security team finds it necessary for new feature, critical infrastrucutre or functionalities.

###

## External pentest

External pentesting is performed by an independent company. Each pentest is based on a specific engagement description, which outlines the test procedures and scope of the testing. External pentesting must produce a report with identified vulnerabilities in a shareable format to customers and other stakeholders. All vulnerabilities identified in the pentest must be mitigated before the report is shared with external stakeholders.
