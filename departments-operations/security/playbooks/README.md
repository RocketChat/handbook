## Server investigation

When contacted about a potentially rogue server, i.e. a server used for criminal purposes, we follow our internal Standard Operating Procedure [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/180rtyc50riGGZAzw8WP4r0EFYEP6FxMWcMbAK5I3V3k/edit?usp=sharing).

Law enforcement inquiries are subject to our [law enforcement guidelines](https://docs.rocket.chat/legal/guidelines-for-law-enforcement).

## Reporting

On a monthly basis, the security team provides a metric sheet to management and presents in the all-hands meeting. The sheet can be found in [GDrive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J6VGHN5znUa07lG7r7wfqa4ewxb8\_AJd-Z7irQEfUXc/edit?usp=sharing). On a weekly basis, the security team reports the status of the current tasks and issues in the all-hands meeting as per an Clickup export and addition to the newsletter.
