# Rocket.Chat's Handbook

{% hint style="info" %} We know it's practically impossible to go through all of it in a single run, so make sure to check our policies from time to time as well as your area's specific documents. {% endhint %}

This Handbook will always be a work-in-progress, and it is everyone's responsibility to keep it up-to-date and relevant.

You are encouraged to update the processes your team or the whole company uses. If your area does not have a section in the menu, go ahead and create one. If you notice some procedures have changed from what's been written, suggest a change.

## Open vs Closed Information

Rocket.Chat is **open** by default. This means that unless something is explicitly prohibited from going public, it should be public. Examples of protected information are employee individual compensation and customer contracts.

## Creating or Editing Pages

To create or edit pages within the Handbook, you will need to login to [Gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/login). If you don't have an account, send a message to [Marcelo Schmidt](./#open-vs-closed-information) to get an invitation link.

After you log in, click the Rocket.Chat Handbook link, then click the 2.0 version:

Then navigate through the menus and find where you want to edit or create a new page.

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (30) (1) (1).png>)

Then click the blue "Edit" button at the top-right portion of your screen.

If you want to edit the current text, just click it and edit in place. You'll see a menu at the right of the text you're editing that allows you to format the text.

By hovering your mouse in between lines you can insert a new paragraph by clicking the plus sign that shows up.

To upload images, just copy and paste into the text.

To create a new menu item, just hover in between items and click the plus sign.

After you are done creating or editing, click the "Submit" button, and that will create a Change Request that can be reviewed and merged.
