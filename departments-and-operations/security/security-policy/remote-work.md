# Remote work

#### Purpose&#x20;

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that Rocket.Chat employees who work remotely maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of company assets, data and information. This policy outlines the security guidelines, clear screen and security requirements for remote workers to follow.

#### **Rules**

1. Confidentiality: Remote workers must maintain the confidentiality of company data, information, and assets by following the company's data protection policies. This includes keeping passwords and sensitive information secure and not sharing it with unauthorized parties.
2. Theft of assets: Employees who work remotely must ensure that their work equipment and assets are secure and protected from theft. This includes using password-protected screensavers, locking their workstations when not in use, applying full encryption on the working device and reporting any loss or theft of assets immediately.
3. Clear Screen: Employees who work remotely must clear their screens before leaving their workstations. This includes closing all applications, logging out of all systems and locking the screen. This will ensure that confidential information is not visible to unauthorized parties.
4. Security Guidelines: Remote workers must follow the company's security guidelines for working remotely. This includes using secure networks, avoiding public Wi-Fi, using only the company email and calendar, and avoiding the use of personal devices for work purposes.
5. Security Requirements: All remote workers must have up-to-date systems and security software, such as the operation system, anti-virus, firewalls and encryption software, installed on their workstations. Remote workers must also keep their security software updated to ensure that they are protected against the latest threats.
6. Remote Access: Remote workers must use secure remote access solutions, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), to access company systems and data whenever they are not working from their home. Employees must also ensure that their remote access solutions are secure and use strong passwords.
7. Keep printouts with work data to an absolute minimum and destroy them securely once done. In general, most of your work should be done paperless.
8. Compliance: Remote workers must comply with this policy and any other relevant security policies and guidelines. Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
9. Regular Reviews: This policy will be reviewed regularly to ensure that it remains relevant and effective. Any changes to this policy will be communicated to all employees.

By following these rules and guidelines, Rocket.Chat employees who work remotely can ensure the security of company assets, data and information, and protect the company from security breaches and data losses.
