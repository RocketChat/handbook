# Resolution of Github Pull Requests

Github Pull Requests are code contributions made by our code contributors \(both internal staff and community members\). The objective of this process is to expedite the resolution of Github PRs created by our community of contributors.

Most healthy open source project maintains a queue of PRs waiting to be reviewed and merged. Maintaining this queue at a reasonable length and avoiding heavy backlog from lead community contributors is the main goal of this process.

_The core of this process is asynchronous communication for faster resolutions._

## 1. Track The PR

Tracking progress of any task is necessary to build a healthy repeatable process.

To achieve that, with each new pull request, the community team member should always follow the below steps -

1. Add him/herself as a reviewer on GitHub.
2. Add the PR to [this clickup list](https://app.clickup.com/4207297/v/li/43369911).
3. Assign the task to him/herself on ClickUp.
4. Add a due date of one week to avoid heavy backlogs in the future.

## 2. Overlap Detection

Ideally a contributor should communicate and share what they want to work on prior to submitting a PR on our open community server's [dev](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/dev) channel. That way we can drive them to the right direction and avoid any potential overlap.

But with such a huge community like ours, overlapping PRs are a big possibility. To resolve the situation, it is critical to understand, with which stage of the internal development pipeline, the community PR is clashing.

Here is a general development pipeline to follow -

```text
Planning -> In Progress -> Completed
```

The `Planning` stage is when the Product Manager or Engineering Manager decides on which features to implement, which bugs to prioritize the current quarter.

Once decided and prioritized, some engineer is assigned to the task. This is the `In Progress` stage, when a developer has been tasked to tackle the job.

Finally when the staff engineer opens a PR, the process is considered to have reached the `Completed` stage. The road to getting that PR merged can be long but for outside contributors, it is considered to be complete.

### Overlap Resolution

We value all our contributions, but if an overlap comes to be, generally the staff PRs get precedence over community contributions. Following is a step by step process of what to do at which stage.

* **Planning stage**  _The community PR is put on hold_.  The community team member then contacts the Product Manager or the Engineering Manager for feature implementations and bug fixes respectively as soon as possible to avoid it reaching any of the next two stages.  _Whether the PR will be accepted or not stays inconclusive in the meantime._  
* **Ongoing stage**  _The community PR is put on hold indefinitely._  It is now upto the community team member to talk to the Engineering Manager or the respective Product Manager for bugs and feature implementations respectively and come up with a resolution.  _It'd be safe to assume that the outside contribution will not be accepted._  
* **Completed stage**  _The community contribution is to be politely rejected._

## 3. Review I

The assigned community team member now determines if the PR is immediately resolvable or not. There are two questions to be asked here -

### Is it a feature implementation?

If it is a feature implementation, does it conform to our product roadmap? _If not, the PR should be politely rejected._

If it conforms to our product roadmap, is the implemented feature planned to be EE only? _If so, the PR should be politely rejected._

If the previous two checks are passed - is there any visible overlap? Go to the previous section for an overlap resolution if there is. Otherwise,

1. Assign the task to the respective Product Manager on ClickUp.
2. Set the appropriate squad.
3. Assign to the respective squal lead.

Is the feature planned to be implemented in the current release? If so, 

* Extend the due date by two weeks.

If it is to be implemented some time in the future,

* Extend the due date to sync with the planned timeline.

### Is it a bug fix?

If it is a bug fix, the community team member attempts to review the PR. If possible, he/she approves the PR for public visibility. Furthermore, he/she must also -

1. Assign the task to the Engineering Manager on ClickUp.
2. Set the appropriate squad.
3. Assign to the respective squad lead on both ClickUp and GitHub.
4. Extend the due date by two weeks.

## 4. Review II

If the PR gets to this stage, one of the developers from the respective squad reviews the PR one more time for quality check and any other issues. This review process can take a couple of days to weeks.

## 5. Final Resolution

Once upto satisfaction and if everything checks out, **the PR gets merged**.
