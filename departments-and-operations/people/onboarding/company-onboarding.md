# Company Onboarding

The onboarding starts as soon as you accept our offer letter. Recurrently, from the day you sign the offer up to your first day with us, you'll receive instructions, additional documents, and other materials you need for joining Rocket.Chat. A few days before your start date, you'll also receive some directions along with your RC and Google Workspace credentials. [HereÂ´s](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10MWbCqEI1X5zAVQvLQj2wx-\_AApiS3dLB6nTYVrLe74/edit#slide=id.gaedb49bd54\_0\_245) a guide made for our New Rocketeers so they know what to expect.

### The Onboarding Certification

The certification will give you a good foundation of knowledge about the company, our departments, the platforms we use, and more! So it's **essential** that you dedicate your first two days to completing the course at your own pace.&#x20;

After completing the Certification, you will be able to:

1. Understand Rocket.Chat, from both the product and business points of view
2. Get resources to identify teams and departmental representatives that are there to help you
3. Find out more about the aspects of your daily life as a Rocketeer
4. Review the tools and systems you will use on a daily basis

During your first day, you'll have an Onboarding Meeting with the People Team for a welcome session. Also, you'll have checkpoint meetings on your 1st, 3rd, and 6th months. The purpose of these checkpoints is to understand, from the new Rocketeer's point of view, how the first weeks were, and how the adaptation is going. It's a safe space for the Rocketeer to share his thoughts, kudos, and improvement suggestions.

### Open Source Townhall & CEO Onboarding

If you're a new Rocketeer, it's beneficial that you don't miss our Townhall Meeting!

The Open Source Townhall & CEO Onboarding is for every new Rocketeer who wants to:

1. Understand more about our open-source background and how it affects our culture code
2. Get to know our CEO and our CppO, and ask them a few questions in a Q\&A session.

This meeting is scheduled for all New Rocketeers, usually at the end of the first month with us.
