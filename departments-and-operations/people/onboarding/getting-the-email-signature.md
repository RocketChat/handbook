# Getting the email signature

Here is the step-by-step on how to get the Rocket.Chat email signature for your Rocket.Chat email account:

* Download the HTML template signature directly from [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Artwork/master/Email/Signatures/Example.html)
* Open the HTML file you downloaded with your browser and copy it.
* Paste the template in the signature settings of your email.
* Change the texts with your info (don't forget to change both, text displays and links).
* Send a test email to a teammate to confirm that your signature appears correctly.
