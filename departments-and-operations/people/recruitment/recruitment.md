# External Recruitment

Our recruitment process has essentially the following steps:

1. **Resume Analysis:** Focusing on analyzing the candidate's experience, matching it with the required level of experience and necessary skills for the job.
2. **Phone Screening:** To focus on initial details that are indispensable for the candidate to hold.
3. **People Interview:** The purpose of this stage is to explore deeper, with a set of behavioural questions, the candidate's fit with our culture, and explain other details about the organization and position.
4. **Hiring Manager Interview:** The hiring manager will conduct this interview and will be the candidate's leader in Rocket.Chat if hired. The purpose of the interview is to assess the candidate's experience and skills to determine whether or not they would be a valuable addition to the organization, as well as to gauge their compatibility with the team in the area.
5. **Executive Interview:** The last stage of the process involves a discussion with the executive in charge of the department. The aim is to understand the candidate's motivations, address their queries, and inform them about what to anticipate as a Rocketeer. The conversation is intended to be informative and engaging for the candidate.

_Note:_ Technical skills for specific positions may be evaluated through a technical challenge stage, which may include role play, live coding or a technical interview with the team.

All of these steps are managed through **Greenhouse,** our ATS, and where all involved interviewers, leaders and recruiters can collaborate during the selection process.
