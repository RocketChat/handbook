# CIPA

In Brazil, CIPA stands for "Comissão Interna de Prevenção de Acidentes," translating to Internal Commission for Accident Prevention. Comprising representatives from both employers and employees, CIPA plays a crucial role in identifying, evaluating, and mitigating workplace hazards. The committee's overarching goal is to create a work environment prioritizing life protection, promoting worker health, and preventing accidents and work-related illnesses.

### Purpose of CIPA

CIPA operates intending to permanently reconcile work with life protection. Even in a remote work setting, we acknowledge the importance of addressing potential risks, including those related to ergonomics, activities in physical offices, and mental health concerns. The committee works to observe, report, and recommend measures to reduce, eliminate, or neutralize these risks, ensuring a comprehensive approach to occupational health and safety.

### Why CIPA Matters

A company's dedication to employee safety extends beyond physical office spaces. Regulated by the Brazilian Ministry of Labor and Employment (Ministério do Trabalho e Emprego - MTE), CIPA is a mandatory committee in workplaces. It emphasizes the importance of safeguarding employees and promoting measures to protect against potential risks.

The active participation of all Rocketeers in CIPA-focused pieces of training not only fortifies the understanding of occupational health and safety but also positions all of our employees as a key advocate for the well-being of our worldwide work community.&#x20;
