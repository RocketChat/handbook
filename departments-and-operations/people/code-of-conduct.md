## Rocket.Chat Code of Conduct

### 1. Respect and Inclusion

At Rocket.Chat, we treat every individual with respect and dignity. We promote an inclusive and diverse environment where we treat all employees, customers, and partners fairly and without discrimination, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, or other characteristics.

### 2. Professionalism

We maintain a high standard of professionalism in all our interactions, both within the organization and with external stakeholders. We communicate with honesty and integrity.

All Rocketeers must show integrity and professionalism in the workplace and in regard to the following areas:

* Corruption and Bribery&#x20;

At Rocket.Chat, we're all about maintaining the highest ethical standards. It's important that every Rocketeer follows anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable regulations. This means no shady payments, being clear and transparent with gifts and entertainment, checking out third parties, and speaking up if you spot any issues. Remember, if you have questions or see any red flags, just reach out to the legal team for guidance.&#x20;

* Job Duties and Authority&#x20;

All Rocketeers should perform their work duties with integrity and respect towards co-workers, customers, stakeholders, and the community.&#x20;

Supervisors and managers must not abuse their authority. We expect them to delegate duties to their team members, taking into account their abilities and workload. We also expect team members to follow instructions given by their leaders and complete their assignments skillfully and in a timely manner. We encourage mentoring throughout our company. If the Rocketeer is taking other paid duties from 3rd parties, it has to be approved by their manager.&#x20;

* Conflict of interest&#x20;

We expect employees to avoid personal, financial, or other interests that might restrain their capability or willingness to perform their job duties. &#x20;

* Collaboration&#x20;

Rocketeers should be friendly and collaborative. They should try not to disrupt the workplace or present obstacles to their colleagues’ work.&#x20;

* Communication&#x20;

Rocket.Chat highly values open and effective communication. We expect Rocketeers to engage in open dialogue with colleagues, supervisors, and team members. When using social media, do not promote our interests by commenting on market consolidations, name changes, or similar events. We build our success on skill and professionalism rather than negative discussions about competitors or others.

* Benefits&#x20;

We expect Rocketeers to not abuse their employment benefits. This can refer to time off, insurance, facilities, subscriptions or other benefits our company offers.&#x20;

* Company Expenses

We try to save money when possible and do not overspend on flights, hotels, restaurants etc. For more information, please refer to our [Travel Policy.](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-M41dOPtnjO7qK6KCyrt/s/-M7hDnLLoVYXnODyaFd3-41739140/departments-and-operations/finance/travel-policy)

* Signature Rights&#x20;

We expect all our employees to respect that only Executive Management has signature rights on behalf of the company. The only exception in rare circumstances is if a specific signatory obligation is delegated and provided in writing.&#x20;

* Policies&#x20;

All employees should read and follow our company policies. If any questions arise, their direct managers can receive and answer them.

### 3. Collaboration and Cooperation

We encourage collaboration, cooperation, and teamwork. We value diverse opinions and perspectives. Our [DOTS](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-M41dOPtnjO7qK6KCyrt/s/-M7hDnLLoVYXnODyaFd3-41739140/the-company/our-culture) (Dream, Own, Trust, and Share) align with these.&#x20;
