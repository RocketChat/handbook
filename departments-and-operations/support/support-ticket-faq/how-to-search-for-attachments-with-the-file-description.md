# How to search for attachments with the file description

The search for attachments with a file description is a bit different from the individual messages search and you actually can search them with a specific prefix.\
To do this, you need to search with the prefix: file-desc: followed by your-file-title

\
Example: **file-desc:testing**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (29) (1).png>)



There is an exception to this type of search, you must not include space and you should type only one word which is part of the description, or a few characters(or syllable) which is part of any word inside the file description (see the above screenshot for better clarity).\
\
At the time of writing this article, the only supported language for this is **English**. However, the Product team is aware of this limitation and working on a fix.
