# Addressing underperformance

Sometimes we might find someone in our team who is underperforming, in terms of results and/or behavior. Since we want our Rocketeers to succeed, we should give them every opportunity to work effectively, therefore it’s important to address signs of underperformance right away. &#x20;

Below are some common signs of underperformance you should pay attention to:

* Lack of results;
* Misinterpretation of the goals;
* Response time;
* The unclear status of work;
* Frustration from other team members;
* Missed goals and timeline.

After diagnosing the problem, start acting!&#x20;

Note that if you are not the manager of the Rocketeer, share your concerns with rocketeer direct manager with as much context and details you can provide.   &#x20;



If you are the manager of the Rocketeer:

1. Give clear and concrete feedback in your next 1:1. Explain the situation, what you have observed, and listen to the Rocketeer. Make sure you are clear on what you expect and be available to help, if needed.
2. If sometime later (2 - 3 weeks) you are still facing the same problem/behavior, we suggest you open an official PIP (Performance Improvement Plan). This will be a formal plan to try to solve the underperformance, a chance to get the Rocketeer back on track.&#x20;

The main objective of the PIP is to support the Rocketeer with a tangible plan and transparent feedback as well as make clear statement that  immediate action and improvements are needed.&#x20;

Here’s how to open a PIP:

1. Let the People Business Partner know about it;
2. Start building the PIP (here is a template);
3. Share the PIP with the People Business Partner in order to exchange ideas and validate the plan (we can always do it together, if you prefer);
4. Present the PIP to the Rocketeer together with someone from the People Team;
5. Follow up the plan for the next few days. We recommend having a plan period between 30 - 90 days and you should have a touch point every week or every 15 days.

Important highlights:&#x20;

* Be very clear on what improvements you expect, why this person is starting a PIP process, and set clear goals (with deadlines, how it will be measured, what is needed, etc).&#x20;
* Don’t forget this is a plan for the individual, not yours. Be careful not to do the job for the person.&#x20;

PIP is something personal and confidential between the manager, the Rocketeer, and the HR Team.&#x20;

**NOTICE:** If the Rocketeer is doing/did something unethical or not aligned to our DOTS you shouldn’t open a PIP. The right decision is to let this person go.&#x20;
