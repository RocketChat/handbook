# Referrals

Do you know that moment when you see that open position for working in Rocket.Chat, and you remember that friend you had that fits **perfectly** with the description? _That person could be our next Rocketeer!_ And the **Referrals** program exists so we can reward our Rocketeers who refer other amazing people to join our team! 

How it's going to work:

1. Fill out the information about your referral here at [this link](https://forms.gle/aXVmnChRtuMHqBtd7). Through this link we'll be able to have a record of it so that you can get into the rewards system!
2. If you're close with this person, tell them to apply for the position on jobs.rocket.chat. In the application there's a field asking how they found out about the job, tell them to choose "Employee Referral". This will make the process of reaching out to this person much easier!

If your referral **joins the team and stays for at least 90 days**, you'll get a reward sponsored by the **Referrals** system! **🍾**

_But are these rewards?_

You'll get an **Experience Pass** ✨ It'll be attributed to you in the form of a credit on Zoho People with the value corresponding to one-month [remote benefit](https://handbook.rocket.chat/company/people/entering-rocket.chat/benefits/remote-benefit) \(see values according to a location in the link\), and the expensing system will be the same as the benefit \(through reimbursement\).

You can use this credit to pay for experiences such as:       

* An awesome dinner
* A class of something you like \(maybe dancing? maybe some sport? maybe cooking?\)
* A surprise breakfast for your loved one
* That game subscription you've always wanted
* An Airbnb Experience 

Any questions you have just reach out to the People Experience team!
