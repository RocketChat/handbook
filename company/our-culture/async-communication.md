# Async Communication

We’re not all in an office together, there are no hallway conversations happening and we can’t just talk up to each others’ desks. In order to operate effectively in our fully remote work setting and consistently further our efforts, we need proactive ownership around our communication on [open.rocket.chat](https://open.rocket.chat/home)

## RAW! It’s how we collaborate async:&#x20;

**R**eact - _recognize if a relevant message_ has been received and understood\
**A**lign - _contribute or engage_ to make sure you understand expectations and the next steps\
**W**ork - _take action_ when you have a job to do. And _let the team know about it_ - now & going forward

When important messages are sent or you’re tagged in conversation, ask yourself: have I reacted, aligned (if needed) and/or signalled that I’m working on it?



Let's make communications that are clear, complete, delivered with kindness, and that create productive results!\
