# RockStars Happy Hour

As a way of recognizing our Rocketeers’ efforts and having some fun together, we hold a quarterly happy hour to celebrate everyone’s hard work! Our award is divided into 13 categories based on the performance of each department, as well as the #rocketchat-thanks channel.

We understand the importance of recognition and want to ensure it is given and received by both peers and leaders.

Check out all the categories and their descriptions for our award below:

1. **Koko Thanks King / Queen:** for the Rocketeer who has gotten the biggest amount of thanks!
2. **Good Vibes King / Queen:** for the Rocketeer who has gotten the biggest amount of Good Vibes cards!
3. **Department Thanks:** to the Rocketeers who have done an outstanding performance in that quarter.
4. **Special Dates:** we also say thanks during special dates such as Mother’s/Father’s Day, International Women’s Day, etc.
5. **DOTS Guardians:** this category celebrates Rocketeers who represent our DOTS perfectly!
6. **Company Years’ Birthday:** for the Rocketeers who have been a part of our rocket for a year or more and are celebrating their anniversary.
