# RockStars Happy Hour

As a way of recognizing our Rocketeers’ efforts and having some fun together, we hold a quarterly Happy Hour to celebrate everyone’s hard work! Divided into 13 categories, our award uses our #rocketchat-thanks channel as a reference, as well as the overall performance divided by department.

We know recognition is very important, so we want to do it right. We also want it to come and go, both from peers and leaders as well.

Check out all the categories and their descriptions for our award below:

1. **Koko Thanks King / Queen:** for the Rocketeer who has gotten the biggest amount of thanks!
2. **Good Vibes King / Queen:** for the Rocketeer who has gotten the biggest amount of Good Vibes cards!
3. **Department Thanks:** to the Rocketeers who have done an outstanding job in that quarter. They are chosen through a selection made by the managers.
4. **Special dates:** we also say thanks during special dates such as Mother’s/Father’s Day, International Women’s Day, etc.
5. **Employee Walk of Fame:** every Rocketeer who shined during the quarter, regardless of the team!
6. **DOTS Guardians:** this is a special category for us because it celebrates the Rocketeers who are staying true to our DOTS and representing them perfectly!
7. **Company years’ birthday:** for the Rocketeers who are celebrating a year or more in our rocket.
