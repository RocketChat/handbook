# 🧑🤝🧑 Our Culture

Our Culture

Being a Rocketeer is about understanding and living our culture on an everyday basis! So you must meet what it is all about since the 1st Day!

Back in 2020, during our annual Summit, something remarkable happened. Every Rocketeer, gathered to explore our collective identity. What does it mean to be a part of this dynamic team? The result was a mosaic of words, expressions, and quotes that encapsulated the essence of us, our spirit, and our drive. This mosaic soon crystallized into what we proudly call our DOTS.

Fast forward to 2023, we went to periods marked by growth and personnel transitions. We recognized the need to recalibrate our DNA, ensuring that it still perfectly mirrored our evolving journey. Upon thorough review, it was clear for us – our core DOTS remained unshaken, just requiring a slight retouch. Every facet of our Culture Code was borne from the voices and souls of Rocketeers, carefully designed to mirror our authentic selves and that remains and still is present on day to day of our organization.&#x20;

Our Culture Code isn't just a set of words. It's crafted with the threads of our shared aspirations, values, and ambitions. It's a living testament to who we were, who we are, and the behaviors and competencies we should expect from every Rocketeer.
