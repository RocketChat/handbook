# Remote Work

Rocket.Chat was born as a global and distributed team, and over the years Rocketeers have been developing their hacks for remote working. We gathered these ideas and created a Remote Work Guide dedicated specially to support our new Rocketeers!

In [this guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WOk8y9Ek7CPRjqoOisXgbnCgbgg3-zXLATkzWlr4aOw/edit?usp=sharing) you'll find some productivity hacks, tips for dealing with multiple time zones, maintaining your work-life balance, and finally, some home office set-up models to inspire you!

Itâ€™s about _sharing_ and growing together!
