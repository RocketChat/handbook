# Reporting Product Issues

To avoid the same product issue being reported in multiple channels, it's important to keep it centralized in one single place. This way, it's possible for the reporter to keep track of the progress and the product team to work on the issue in an organized way.

To report an issue:

·         Click [`here`](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues)to get to our github issues page and check if the issue has already been reported. If it has, and you don't have anything new to add, keep track of the resolution progress. If it has already been reported and you have something to add, please add it as a comment.

&#x20;·         In case the issue has not been reported yet, submit your issue/bug using below steps.

## Steps by step to report an issue:

1-On Rocket.Chat github main repo issues page ([https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues)) click on “New Issue” button on the top right of the screen.

&#x20;2-Click on “Get Started” button on the Bug Report lane\
