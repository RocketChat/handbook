# Support

The Rocket.Chat Support team is responsible for ensuring customer success.

## Team

- [Bruno Raymundo](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/bruno.raymundo) - Support Lead
- [Jonas Friedmann](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/frdmn) - Support Analyst

## Tools

We are currently using OTRS as our main support system. Customers can either create tickets directly on the platform or by sending an email to [support@rocket.chat](mailto:support@rocket.chat)

## Workflow

The basic support workflow is defined in the chart below. First level support is done mainly by our partners at [WOW24-7](https://wow24-7.io/). Issues are escalated to higher levels as appropriate:

Closed tickets also have their own workflow in order to ensure actionable items for each type of issue raised by customers:

In summary closed tickets should have one of three possible outcomes:

- If it's a **usability** issue, an existing document should be linked to the ticket and/or updated to reflect new knowledge
- If it's a **functionality** issue, an existing GitHub feature request should be linked to the ticket and updated or a new one created to raise visibility to the customer request
- If it's a **reliability** issue, an existing GitHub bug should be linked to the ticket and updated or a new one created to raise visibility to the problem reported
