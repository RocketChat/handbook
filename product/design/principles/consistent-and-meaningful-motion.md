# Consistent and Meaningful Motion

Real-world is not static so the product either. However, the motion must be consistent on its timing and curve as well as meaningful, leaving cues to the audience so they can understand the affordance of a component.

## Validation Guide

* All means of interaction must be represented by a visual cue, you may use motion in most of these cases;
* All short CSS transitions, animations and transforms must follow our [animation curve base ](../rules/animation-curve-and-timing.md)and its timing.
