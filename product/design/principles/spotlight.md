# Spotlight

Its purpose is to direct the audience's attention, as fewer Spotlight areas we have at the same time, as focused the users will be on their current task.

## Validation Guide

* Are all CTAs available \(at the same time\) really necessary? Can we focus just on some of them during this specific user task?
* Are important information been hidden in the clutter?
