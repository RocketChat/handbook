# Recognition Rather than Recall

Do not overload the user's memory, add visual cues through their journey so they can recognize rather than recall. The recognition is easier than recall because it is connected to more cues; information spread which activate that related information in their memory.

## Validation Guide

* Do the users need to recall a information which is not available at that moment? Design a few cues in the UI so they can recognize that;
* Does this mental model already exist within our product?
* Did you use words already used in the system?
* Can the user recognize the information on the previous steps?
