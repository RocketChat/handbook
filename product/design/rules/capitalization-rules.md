# Capitalization Rules

## Use verbs in titles

An action-specific title shows that a button is interactive and says what happens when you use it.

## Use title-case for titles

Capitalize every word except articles, coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions of four or fewer letters.

## Keep titles short

Follow the principle of [Minimalism](../principles/#minimalism). Overly long text can crowd your interface and may get truncated on smaller screens.
