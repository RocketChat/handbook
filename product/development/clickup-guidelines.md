# Clickup Guidelines

## Backend

Each task will start in `TO DO`. That means no one is actively working on it. You can take any task from this list that's not currently assigned to someone.

As soon as you get something to work on, you should change the task's status to `IN PROGRESS`.

If, during your development, you find something that you cannot workaround or you have an important question, you should update the status to `BLOCKED`.

* When doing this, remember to \*\*leave a comment\*\* with the reason for the block or with the questions you have

When you finish the development, you should move it to `WAITING REVIEW`.

* Please, notify the reviewer via DM or email, or adding him/her as a reviewer in `GitHub`.

When you are reviewing a task from someone else \(doing code review\), you should change the status to `IN REVIEW`.

* If the review is OK \(no comments or questions, and everything is working out properly\), you can now move the task to `DONE`.
* Else, notify the developer and move the task back to `IN PROGRESS` so the dev can work on your review.
