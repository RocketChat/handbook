# Summit

Rocket.Chat holds an annual summit to get the entire team together. Attendance is optional but highly recommended to:

* meet new remote team members in person
* develop and strengthen relationships
* get a deeper understanding of our team's strengths and weaknesses
* align projects with the executive team's short, medium and long term objectives and vision

  We do a bit of work and planning at summits but focus more on team building activities.
