# ðŸ”¤ Glossary

## Metrics

#### Prospect:

* Visitors on the website or any other medium, although they didnâ€™t share any type of personal/company information or interest (sources).
* Responsible: Marketing

#### Lead:

* Someone that expresses interest and shares more information that has:
  * Shared personal information but no company information
  * Registered on newsletter, events, etc
* Responsible: Marketing

#### Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL):

* Someone that expresses interest and shares more information regarding the company that has:
  * Shared individual and company information
* This is the point where the lead is ready to talk to an SDR
* Responsible: Marketing

#### Product Qualified Lead (PQL):

* Someone that has engaged on a free trial or in our community version and has a score above a threshold considering size, industry, and country.
* This is the point where the lead is ready to talk to an SDR
* Responsible: Marketing and Product

#### Sales Qualified Lead (SQL):

* Someone that the SDR has already talked to and fits the target profile has the pain identified, and the timing is right.
  * At this stage, the SDR will have already talked to the client and identified a potential opportunity (need, time, authority, budget)
* This is the point where the lead is ready to talk to a closer
* Responsible: Sales (SDR)

**Forecasting Category (former "Confidence Level" on Zoho CRM):**

* Commit (former "Very Confident"): either a late-stage deal OR a well-progressed deal that the rep says will close as part of their forecast for the current quarter. All deals in Verbal Approval with a closing date in the current quarter must be selected as Commit.
* Best Case: upside or viable opportunities that could be accelerated to close in this quarter or advance with solid chances for us to win eventually. Rep has a solid amount of confidence in closing but may miss a key "SPICED" element such as decision-maker, timing, OR any other. However, two things must be certain: we can solve their PAIN and they see IMPACT.
* Early Stage: uncertainty on many key elements of the SPICED framework that limit the ability to have any higher confidence level or inclusion in committed forecast number.
* Omitted: For just created opportunity or super early prospecting/discovery analysis. Opportunities may only exist because the company is in our ICP. Likely only "situation" or no elements of the SPICED framework have been identified/validated.

**Forecasting Scenarios:**

* Optimistic:
  * Commit = 100%; Best Case = 50%; Early Stage = 10%
* Base:
  * Commit = 90%; Best Case = 40%; Early Stage = 0%
* Conservative:
  * Commit = 80%; Best Case = 35%; Early Stage = 0%

#### Lagged Contracts:

* New Sale / Upsell contracts closed at t, but starting at t + 1 (i.e. closed in April, but starts in May)

#### Contract Consumption:

* How much (%) of the total contract has been consumed.

#### Logos:

* Synonym for "Company" used in the context of Logo Churn and New Logo.

#### Opportunity (Opp):

* Someone that was verified by the sales team (closer/hunter) that benefits from the product and passes the SLA of opportunity.
  * At this stage, the Closer will have already talked to the client and identified an opportunity (need, time, authority, budget)
* Responsible: Sales (Closer)

#### ACV = Annual Contract Value:

* All contracts (Non-recurring such as Events and Professional services included)

* "Amount" field in Zoho CRM fields
* Back to our previous example Ex1 = $10k and Ex2 = $10k

#### Bookings ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue):

### **Partners**

We use the "Partner (Lookup)" field from the Deals module on Zoho CRM to define which partner is related to an opportunity and create the proper metrics on Zoho Analytics.

We also have a "Partner (Lookup)" field in the Accounts module on Zoho CRM but it's only used for visual reference by the Salespeople.
