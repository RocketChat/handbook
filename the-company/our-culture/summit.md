# Summit

The Summit is the most anticipated moment for our team, as it's the time when we bring the entire team together. Although attendance is optional, we highly recommend joining because the Summit offers the opportunity to meet all team members in person.

Since we mainly work remotely, the Summit provides a unique chance to gather all Rocketeers in a single location and embody our culture. This way, when we're all together, it feels as if we've never been far apart.

Participating in the Summit offers:

* [ ] Develop and strengthen relationships;
* [ ] Gain a deeper understanding of our team's strengths and weaknesses;
* [ ] Align projects with the Executive Team for the short, medium, and long term;
* [ ] Engage in team-building activities and discussions about the company's strategies.
