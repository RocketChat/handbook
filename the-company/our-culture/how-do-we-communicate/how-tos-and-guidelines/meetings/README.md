# Meetings

## Control Your Calendar

* Reserve blocks of time to do focused work
* Create meeting-free days every week
* Just say no OR delegate
* Configure a 25 minutes default meeting duration
* Define speedy meetings to have 5 or 10-minute intervals

## Respect Others' Calendars

* Always confirm if you are attending or not
* Read the agenda and materials sent out in advance
* Join the meeting on time

## Host Good Meetings

* Prepare an agenda
* Avoid the status meetings
* Invite only the people who need to attend (mark other people as optional)
* Start and end on time
* Donâ€™t rehash materials sent out in advance
* Send out a summary of the next steps

## Organizing Recurrent Meetings

* Schedule recurring meetings at the beginning of the week
