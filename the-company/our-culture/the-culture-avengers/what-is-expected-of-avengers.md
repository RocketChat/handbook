Culture Avengers are a cross-functional and multilevel team that brings different perspectives and experiences into maintaining and modifying our culture. They bring an accurate perception of the good and bad of our current culture into planning effective actions and strategies.

## II-What is an Avenger?

In short an Avenger is a guardian of the culture, a role model for what we aspire to be. \
Being an Avenger will allow you to be an active player in Rocket.Chat's culture, regularly advising and acting on our initiatives and being role models for what we aspire to be.

Note that being an avenger is a role and not a job assignment. \
Also Avengers activities should not take a toll on your regular job activities as well as your regular job activities should not prevent you from being an active member of the Avengers.&#x20;

## IV-Red Flags to Be Aware Of:

Red flags in general are a concern for any member of the company in any team. We understand Avengers is an additional workload, but still is a commitment all participants chose to be a part of and have. Avengers are guardians of the culture, so we are here to lead by example.&#x20;

Below are a few items that are considered red flags.&#x20;

\-Disregard for diversity, inclusion, or the values of Dream, Trust, Own, and Share.

In case the sponsor, avengers lead or other members see any red flags Avenger will receive a direct warning. If the situation is not remediated, the person will be removed from the Avengers.
