# The Culture Avengers

An important part of thriving as an organization is having a strong, consistent culture, especially when you have a distributed team. One important way of achieving this is through a Culture Committee, and ours goes by: **The Culture Avengers**.

The Culture Avengers are a cross-functional and multilevel team that brings different perspectives and experiences into maintaining and modifying our culture, they bring an accurate perception of the good and bad of our current culture into planning effective actions and strategies together.

Being an Avenger will allow you to be an active player in Rocket.Chat's culture, regularly advising and acting on our initiatives and being role models for what we aspire to be.
