# Content Marketing: A Quick Look at Rocket.Chat's Strategy

Rocket.Chat's content strategy is based on Inbound Marketing, a methodology to attract, engage & delight customers by creating valuable content. 

**Types of Content**

There are different types of pieces with varying goals behind each of them. The main styles used at Rocket.Chat are:

- Blog posts
- Press releases
- Social Media posts
- Ebooks
- Infographics
- Guest Posts
- Branded content


**Ideation and Request**

We're open to content requests and ideas from any Rocket.Chat team member; however, it's important to note that our content efforts are primarily focused on  Marketing Campaigns; therefore, content pieces that are not related to our main goals might not be prioritized.

If you wish to request a content piece, follow these steps:

1. Decide on the content format
2. Create a Google Docs briefing us about the following details:
   1. Content Topic (Send as many details as possible)
   2. Target Audience (Who is our target reader for that piece?)
   3. Goal (e.g. Lead generation; Brand exposure, etc.)
   4. Results expected from the piece
   5. Main channels for content promotion (if applicable)
3. After answering these questions, message us in #rocket.chat-marketing with the final link for the briefing. 

After receiving your request, the team will discuss the idea and give you a return as soon as possible.

Thank you. Let's do this! :)
