# Job Descriptions

This is to be used by all leadership team. We have to fill it up to every position that you have in your team.

Note, that it is a good tool to help you even when you don't have a member of a team. It will be very useful when you decide to open a position for your team. So it will be more clear to recruit and also, to engage more the candidate in your job description, and for last join the company.

When do I have to use?

* Every new member of your team must have one.
* Also, everytime that someone has any position movement done, it will be required.
* It's the main tool of your onboarding team to use as a development strategy.

We suggest this workflow:

1. Leader creates a version in Github
2. Leader defines/ fills up every Welcoming Talk to each position already opened in his/her team
3. Send to People Operations \(HR\) to  help the validation
4. Leader set up a meeting with every member of the team to present

We believe that by following this workflow, we will develop our team and will get it more engaged in our projects, improving also the behavior and happiness of the team as a whole.

In the future we will use, also, to development and move people from different areas. As long as everyone knows what are the skills and key activities to need in each position, it will be easier to create an action/development plan to achieve what the position requires.
