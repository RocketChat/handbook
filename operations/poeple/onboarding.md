## Meeting the team

If you are working remotely, we recommend you arrange meetings with Gabriel, Marcelo and at least your direct team members using the [team page](https://rocket.chat/team). Try to speak to other teams' members as well.

## Add yourself to the team page

The [Rocket.Chat team page](https://rocket.chat/team) shows the members of the core Rocket.Chat team. The list is ordered by start date with the most recent members at the bottom.

Each team member is featured with their job title, professional photo and link to their GitHub profile \(if appropriate\).

It is each team member's responsibility to add their own information and photo to the page once they join. The below section shows you how to do this.

### Prerequisites

1. Learn how to add content to the [marketing website](../marketing/).
2. Create a branch with an appropriate name `add-firstname-lastname-to-team-page`.

### Add your profile

1. Open `_data/team.yml`.
2. Add a new record at the bottom of the file with the following fields:
3. `name`: full name
4. `title`: from your contract
5. `department`: from your contract
6. `username`: Rocket.Chat username in the format `firstname.lastname`
7. `github_username`: GitHub username to link your profiles
8. `github_uid`: GitHub user id, add if you want to use your GitHub profile photo
9. `photo`: **yes/no** If you've added your own photo to the website

### Add your photo

If you are using your GitHub profile photo instead of uploading a photo skip this section and create a pull request.

* Add your photo to the `images/team/member/` folder.
* Use the following naming format `firstname-lastname-01.jpg` all lowercase.
* If you are in the Porto Alegre office and need a photo speak to Arthur.
