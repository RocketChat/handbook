# Paid Time Off Policy

Rocket.Chat encourages everyone to take some paid time off \(PTO\) off whenever you need it, be it for visiting exotic places or just taking some time for yourself. This is important for maintaining a healthy work/life balance.

## PTO Guide

1. You may take as many days off as you want, as long as your work is organised and in order, i.e. that your work or responsibilities are not compromised by your absence.
2. We suggest between 10 and 30 days of vacation per year.
3. What we care about are your results, not how long you work. While you don't need to ask approval for time off, it shouldnâ€™t be at the expense of business getting done. Please coordinate with your team before taking time off, especially during popular or official holidays, so that we can ensure business continuity. We want to ensure we have adequate coverage and avoid situations where all/most of the team is taking time off at the same time.
4. We don't frown on people taking time off, but rather encourage people to take care of themselves and others by having some time away. If you notice that your co-worker is working long hours over a sustained period, you may want to let them know about the time off policy.
5. Emergencies, by definition are unexpected. They can range from natural disasters, terrorist events, accidents, family deaths, hospitalization and any other unexpected situation. During these times we ask team members to use their best judgement as well as listen to and adhere to public safety officials when possible. If an unexpected emergency occurs please contact your manager via our Open Service or email or whatsapp as soon as possible if you will be unavailable or unable to work. This will allow your manager to confirm your safety and reassign any critical work during your absence. If you do not have an emergency contact in Zoho People please go ahead and complete that section. We will only contact that person if we are unable to reach you via Open, email or phone.
6. When you decide which days you want to take off, please request them in Zoho People \([https://people.zoho.com/rocketchat/zp\#leavetracker/applyleave](https://people.zoho.com/rocketchat/zp#leavetracker/applyleave)\) so that everyone knows you will be away during that period.

1. For every period you decide to take off, you must request it no fewer than twice as many business days plus one. For example, assuming someone wants leave from June 1, 2020 until June 12, 2020 they would have to request PTO on or before May 11, 2020 \(21 business days before\) as this is a total of 10 business days.  Exceptions are listed on Types of Time Off, below.
2. You are free to take some time off to go to the gym, go grocery shopping, take a nap, do household chores, help someone, etc. If something comes up or takes longer than expected, you have urgent tasks and you're able to communicate, just ensure the rest of the team knows and someone can pick up any of your urgent tasks.
3. As part of our new policy 2020, Rocket.Chat will give all employees the opportunity from 18/12/2020 to 01/01/2021 to be used as vacation / PTO. In this case the employee may use your 15 days of  vacation entitlement / PTO.

   In the same way we are making available the period from 02/24/2020 to 02/28/2020 for use of 5 days of vacation / PTO.

4. Being part of a global onsite/remote team means you need to be highly organized and a considerate team player. Each team has busy times so it is always a good idea to check with them to ensure there is adequate coverage in place.
5. Don't forget to always check with your line manager and/or project manager before requesting time off. Operations Team and People Experience will be able to support if needed as well.

   This is to ensure no deadlines are being overseen and to provide them with enough time to accommodate resources. The following question will help determine if you may take time off: "During that time, will someone be able to take over your duties? Does this someone need training?"

6. After the PTO has been approved, update your own calendar using Google's "out of office" feature and include the dates you plan to be away in your automated response. Note that this feature will automatically decline any meeting invitations during the time frame you select.

## Types of Time Off

1. **Casual**: days you'd like to take off, but in case of emergency you may be contacted
2. **Vacation**: days you would not like to be contacted by any means
3. **Sick**: this is an exception to the rule concerning the number of days you need to request before leave ;D Whenever you're sick, please add that day as a sick day type of time off
4. **Half-day**: for when you know you'll be available during half of the day only
5. **Maternity**: duh, paternity as well :\)

## Recognizing Burnout

It is important for us to take a step back in order to recognize and acknowledge the feelings of being "burned out". We are not as effective or efficient when we work long hours, miss meals or forego nurturing our personal lives for sustained periods of time. If you feel yourself or notice someone on your team experiencing burnout, be sure to address it right away. To get ahead of a problem, be sure to communicate with the COO and/or CEO if the following statement ever applies to you, "I'm feeling like I might burn out if the situation doesn't change."

If you or your peers are showing signs of burnout, you should take time out to focus on things that relax you and improve your overall health and welfare. We as a team should address burnout right away by discussing options with each other to evaluate the workload and manage contributing stressors.

Other tips to avoid burnout include:

* Assess and pursue your interests, skills and passions
* Take breaks during the day to eat healthy foods
* Make time each day to increase blood and oxygen circulation which improves brain activity and functionality
* Get plenty of restful sleep
