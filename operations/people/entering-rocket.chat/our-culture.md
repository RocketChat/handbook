# Our Culture

Being a Rocketeer is about understanding and living our culture on an everyday basis! So it's really important that you meet what it is all about since your day 1.

Our Culture Code was created in 2019 during our yearly Summit. We brought every single member of our team together to talk about which actions, behaviors and mindsets represent us as Rocketeers, and as a result we got a set of words, expressions and quotes that afterwards were compiled and became part of our Culture Code, composing our purpose, our values and the behaviors that represent us.

So keep in mind that everything you see in our Culture Code was once mentioned by one or more Rocketeers and purposely built that way so it may truly represent who we are!
