## Brazilian Rocketeers

In Brazil everyone is hired as a CLT employee and receives the mandatory benefits:

* Meal ticket of R$25/day. 
* Transportation card \(For those in the Porto Alegre region\)
* Health plan \(Unimed or Amil\)

The benefit package for Brazilians also includes:

* Gympass
* Remote Work benefit

## Rocketeers in other countries

For Rocketeers in other countries we offer the benefit of support to Remote work, a monthly amount of money you accumulate every month and that you can spend in:

* Infrastructure for your home office
* Body and mental health
* Internet bills

We're constantly looking for new possibilities and trying to bring a better set of benefits to our Rocketeers, so any suggestions or feedbacks can be directed to the People Experience team, who's glad to receive them!
