# Remote Benefit

Being a remote team and an international company comes with many things that are non-traditional, things like getting people on remote all-hands meetings. It also brings along several aspects that are quite unique to the business side, such as different ways of paying employees, perks, benefits and when to give people holidays. 

One reason our benefits structure operates differently is because we are remote and international, however, another reason is that we want our benefits to reflect our values and our desire to create a workplace of the future. So with this proposal of benefit we hope to achieve this goal.

The Remote work benefit comes as a way of helping our Rocketeers work comfortably according to what is important to each and every person, adjusting to everyone's needs. It consists on a monthly budget you accumulate and can use to either:

* Equip your home office with any gadgets you need
* Invest on your mind and/or body health
* Pay for internet bills
* Pay for coworking fees

The monthly amount varies according to your location and the benefit works through reimbursement of the spent value. You can see the whole explanation on how to use it in [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CNLIR0KP2bKmKsfniOa2lvpdSxsNMzqdX-jxFEyf5xg/export?format=pdf).
