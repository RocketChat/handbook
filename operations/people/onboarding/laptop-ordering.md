# Laptop Ordering

The following instructions for laptop ordering apply to employees in any country.

The laptop ordering process starts as soon as all documents for registration of a candidate as employee are received, after the Welcome email is sent by the People Experience team - two to one weeks prior to the first day of the employee - so there's enough time for him/her to order and receive the laptop before having to start working.

One of the first steps joining Rocket.Chat is to procure your own laptop and submit for reimbursement. We follow this kind of process for a couple of reasons:

* To reduce the amount of time necessary to get a laptop to you, since otherwise we'd need to order a laptop to the office and only then send it to you.
* This way we can have a quick response to the different technology needs of each position, as each new employee can order the laptop according to his/her job.

## Placing your order

To place your order you follow these steps:

1. Obtain **two quotes** from local retailers \(online or physical\). For the research you can follow the **specifications** below: _Non devs: Core i5 9th or 10th generation, 8GB or 16GB RAM, 256 GB SSD Devs: Core i7 9th or 10th generation, 16GB RAM, 256 SSD \(preference to dedicated video card\)_ If you’re in the US or Europe we usually prioritize Apple notebooks, and for any other places we prioritize Dell and Lenovo, however this is not mandatory and you can choose from other brands also. But keep in mind that up to a price of 2 thousand dollars you can choose from whichever brand you prefer, if the price goes over this we'll need to evaluate the quotes sent. 
2. **Email marcelo.schmidt@rocket.chat with the quotes** attached and informing if you will need the money in advance or pay and get reimbursed later. He will then indicate you which one to purchase and forward his approval to Accounting for final approval and dispensation. **Once approved you’ll receive a term of Agreement to Use Company Assets**.
3. You can either order **as soon as you receive the approval** from Accounting \(considering you have enough credit card limit for the purchase\) or **you can wait for the advance** to reach your account. Either way, as soon as you place your order you need to **send the** **receipt to accounting@rocket.chat**.

## After the delivery

As soon as you receive your laptop you need to follow two crucial steps before starting to work:

1. The laptop needs to be reported with serial numbers, make, model and other details by adding it to [this form](https://people.zoho.com/rocketchat/zp#compensation/form/add-formLinkName:asset). 
2. New laptops should be configured with security in mind, so before working you need to read and fill [this security form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffmdQUSHaE2WWX6UHo8BAqT6VM0ijBPxyWwJCkmgeRvSpvkA/viewform?usp=sf_link) that will guide you through the necessary configurations you need to do.

## Property

Laptops paid for by the company are property of Rocket.Chat, so you do not need to buy insurance for them unless it is company policy to do so, which at the moment isn't. You do need to report any loss following or damage to the Chief Operations Officer - Marcelo - as soon as it occurs.

In case you eventually leave the company, there is a Buy Back policy which will be described further.

If you, however, decide not to purchase then we will have them ship to our office and expense the shipping costs. All team-member laptops must be securely erased before being returned. This not only protects the company, but also protects you since it is possible for personal information to exist on these machines. Reformatting a computer is not sufficient in these cases because it is possible for sensitive data to be recovered after reinstalling an operating system.

## Buy Back policy

You can buy back your existing laptop either when it gets replaced for a new one, or when you're offboarding. In these cases you have the option to purchase your laptop for the residual value from Rocket.Chat. The residual value is calculated using the Straight-Line Depreciation method, as described in your Agreement to Use Company Assets, that you'll receive once your purchase is approved.

The People Experience team will email you asking if you would like to send back or purchase your laptops. If purchasing, our COO will approve, and we will send you an email with the determined value. Then, if you decide to move forward with purchasing, our accounting department will reach out with payment information.

If you decide to retain the laptop, you are required to wipe the machine and re-install the base operating system, and remove any and all software and configurations that were supplied by Rocket.Chat. Evidence or a declaration that the device has been wiped must be supplied within 2 weeks of the end of employment. If we discover that a device has not been wiped according to policy, we may act to enforce a remote wipe without notice.

## Repairs

If you need to replace a battery or something small that does not affect the productivity or speed of the device, please go ahead and get that small item replaced and expensed by talking to the COO. If the repair is going to take longer than a day then you need to make sure you have a back up laptop to work on.

If, however, the repair is going to be expensive and take weeks to fix and you have no back up laptop, your best option is to replace the laptop. In this case return the first laptop by shipping it to our office \(your shipping costs will be expensed\) and remember all laptops must be returned within 2 weeks of receiving the replacement, so please prioritize transferring information between laptops within this time frame.
