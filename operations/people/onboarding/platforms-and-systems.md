# Platforms and Systems

In our daily basis we use different platforms and systems, here you'll find a list of them and what we use them for:

* **open.rocket.chat**: It is the open source server of Rocket.Chat, where our company channels are and where the magic happens! 
* **Clickup**: That's where we can see our and everyone's daily tasks by teams and projects, seeing its level of priority, due date, and all necessary info.
* **Officevibe**: This is the platform that informs us about our organizational climate. It sends a weekly survey to everyone’s email with different topics such as feedback, recognition and happiness. Through these answers we can know how our team is feeling, it generates our eNPS and more numbers we can use to know where to act! So it's **really** important that you take 5 minutes every week to answer these polls.
* **Github**: The platform where our open source code is available, where the collaborative coding happens.
* **Zoho**: Zoho has a million possibilities, in their system you'll find apps for almost any area and activity, such as:
  * **People**: In People you also find a people database, vacation requests, applications for PTOs, 1:1s and remote benefit request forms. In here we also do our Development check-ins!
  * **Vault**: If you ever want to share any passwords with anyone you don't have to use the chat, you should/must use Vault!
  * **Sign**: It is Zoho's digital signature tool.
  * **Desk**: It is where the support's tickets are stored.
  * **CRM**: It’s where we have the company's sales information.
  * **Campaigns**: Also for creating campaigns.

Different areas also use other specific platforms and you'll slowly get familiar with all of those too!
