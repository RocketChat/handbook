# Monthly payment

## Rocketeers in Brazil

When you first joined you answered a form asking you if you already had a Santander account, because you will need an account in that bank to receive the monthly payment. But don't worry, **you don't have to go and create one already**! 

If you haven't received it yet, the team in charge of filling your admission will soon reach out to you and give you a letter, this is a letter that you can take to a Santander agency to open a **salary account**. __This kind of account doesn't bring you additional monthly fees that other accounts do. While in the agency, you can already request for the **portability** of your account to the account and bank you use today, meaning any money that gets to your salary account immediately goes to the one you choose.

The payment gets to you in the last day of each month.

## Rocketeers in other countries

If you are in any country that is not Brazil, your payment is done through invoices. So for us to pay you we need you to send Rocket.Chat an invoice each month, below you will find a little tutorial on how to create and send them, it is very simple!  

1. You can generate the invoice through any platform you prefer, but we always recommend [invoice-generator.com](http://invoice-generator.com/), since it is free and has almost all functionalities you will need.
2. Go to [invoice-generator.com](http://invoice-generator.com/), fill out your full name and address on "Who is this invoice from".
3. On "Bill to", fill this out: _Rocket.Chat Technologies Corp. 251 Little Falls DR, Wilmington, DE 19808_
4. Leave "Ship to" empty.
5. Invoice number - marked by a \# - is 1, and you increment it every month.
6. "Date" is your current date.
7. On "Payment terms" write "upon receipt".
8. "Due date" is also current date.
9. "Item": _Rocket.Chat Services_ "Quantity": 1 "Rate": Your salary in USD
10. On "Notes" you will need to write down your bank information, including: bank name, bank address, account number, routing number and swift code. Those informations are required to make international payments. If you don't know them, consult your bank.
11. Just **send** the invoice!
