# Development Check-in

Considering how dynamic the world we live in is - specially being inside a technology start-up - talking about development and performance only yearly is almost a risk for the growth of the company and its members. This scenario needs continuous feedbacks combined with in depth reviews targeting the development of the team member. That is why the Development Check-in comes as an optimization of performance reviews that focuses on the improvement of each Rocketeer's performance.

## How it works

The Check-in happens every quarter and has 3 phases: 

1.  **Self-reviews, leader-team and team-leader reviews**: In this step you'll answer a forms about yourself, another about your leader and if you're a leader one for each of your team members. The questions are related to our values and focused on feedforwards \(meaning how can I perform better from now on\).
2. **The Check-in Talks**: After all forms are answered all leaders have a talk with each team member to discuss and compare answers, give and receive feedbacks, and based on them create a plan of objectives of personal and career development to keep track of during the quarter. 
3. **The final round of feedbacks**: The People Experience team talks with each leader to gather perceptions about the process, the team development and to guide on future actions. The Check-in was created to be the closure of a cycle of 1:1s. The objectives for the team's development are created during the Check-in talks and during the quarter's 1:1s the leader mentors on how to achieve them, also being able to create new objectives and eliminate the ones that no longer make sense for the Rocketeer.
