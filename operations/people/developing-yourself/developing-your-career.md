# Developing your career

At Rocket.Chat you are invited to think about your own path:

* What do you want to achieve?
* What can you do and what have you been doing to achieve these goals?

After you know your goals we'll offer the tools to support your development and the achievement of those. These tools are the Development Check-ins together with the 1:1s.

During the Check-ins you'll have the process leading you to talk about your career development, but during the rest of the quarter after the Check-in, you shouldn't lose focus on that and use the 1:1s to continue the talk!

Remember you are an active player in your development! So use all the tools you have to find your strengths and plan your future!
