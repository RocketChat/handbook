# How to use our Handbook

This Handbook will always be a work-in-progress, and it is everyone's responsibility to keep it up-to-date and relevant.

You are encouraged to update the processes your team or the whole company uses. If your area does not have a section in the menu, go ahead and create one. If you notice some procedures have changed from what's been written, suggest a change.

## Open vs Closed Information

Rocket.Chat is **open** by default. This means that unless something is explicitly prohibited from going public, it should be public. Examples of protected information are employee individual compensation and customer contracts.

## Creating or Editing Pages

To create or edit pages within the Handbook, you will need to login to [Gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/login) using your Github account. By hovering your mouse over the items in the menu area, you will see a plus icon that allows you to create new pages. You can also click the "New +" menu item, in the bottom.

To edit an existing page, just open it on Github and make your changes directly in the text.

After you are done creating or editing, click the "Save" button, and that will create a draft that can be reviewed and merged.
