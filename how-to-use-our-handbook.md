# How to use our Handbook

The Handbook will always be a work-in-progress and it's everyone's responsibility to keep it up-to-date and relevant. You are encouraged to update the processes your team or the whole company uses. If your area doesn't have a section in the menu, go ahead and create one. If you noticed some procedures changed from what's been written, suggest a change.

## Open vs Closed Information

Rocket.Chat is **open** by default. This means that unless something is explicitly prohibited from going public, it should be public. Examples of protected information are employee individual compensation and customer contracts.

## Creating or Editing Pages

To create or edit pages withing the Handbook, you'll need to login to \[Gitbook\]\([https://app.gitbook.com/login](https://app.gitbook.com/login)\) using your Github account. By hovering your mouse over the items in the menu area, you'll see a plus icon that allows you to create new pages. You can also click the "New +" menu item, in the bottom.

To edit an existing page, just open it and make your changes directly in the text.

After you are done creating or editing, click the "Save" button, and that will create a draft that can be reviewed and merged.
