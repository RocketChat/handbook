# ‚úç Contributing to handbook

This Handbook will always be a work in progress, and everyone is responsible for keeping it up-to-date and relevant.

You are encouraged to update the processes your team or the whole company uses. If your area does not have a section in the menu, go ahead and create one. Suggest a change if you notice some procedures have changed from what's been written.

## Open vs Closed Information

Rocket.Chat is **open** by default. This means that unless something is explicitly prohibited from going public, it should be public. Examples of protected information are employee individual compensation and customer contracts.

## Creating or Editing Pages

To create or edit pages within the Handbook, you must log in to [Gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/login). If you don't have an account, send a message to [Marcelo Schmidt](contributing-to-handbook.md#open-vs-closed-information) to get an invitation link.

After you log in, click the Rocket.Chat Handbook link, then click the 2.0 version:

Then navigate through the menus and find where you want to edit or create a new page.

Then click the blue "Edit" button at the top-right portion of your screen.

If you want to edit the current text, click it and edit in place. You'll see a menu at the right of your editing text that allows you to format the text.

By hovering your mouse in between lines, you can insert a new paragraph by clicking the plus sign that shows up.
